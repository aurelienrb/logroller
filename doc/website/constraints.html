<h3>Constraints of a modern [C++ logging] library</h3>

<p>There is almost no big project started from scracth
</p>

<p>There are many dumb programmers. They just want things to work.
They were supposed to finish they work one month ago, and they really
don't have the time to read the doc. They want to be able to install
and use the library with almost no configuration. They want to understand
the basic usage and become productive in few minutes. 
</p>

<p>There are many good programmers. They have a very good knowledge of
the subject, and some of them are more talented than the libary writers.
They will focus on very small details that are totaly imperceptible
to most of the rest of the world. They can make a first positive or
negative opinion of your library in only few minutes. They fell
comfortable with manually compiling, installing, and configuring the
library. They can even participate in the development if they are happy
of the overall work done. They are the people who create the (good or bad)
reputation of a library, because they are generaly respected and considered
able to emit a pertinent judgement on the subject. A single article of
such a person (on his blog for example) can really help in making
your library become popular.
