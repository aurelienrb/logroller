<h3>The concept of channels</h3>

<img src="images/28628_soundmixer_v2.jpg" width="150" heigh="112" />

<p>I have no idea who first had the idea of logging channels, but I fell it
is related to the "log4j project". By the way, it is the essence of this
library (they call them "loggers"), it is present in all its clones, and
it has influences other libraries too.
</p>

<p>Here is the basic idea, as it is implemented by log4j:
</p>

<p>The logging space is split in several <i>channels</i>, which can themselves
be subdivised into sub-channels, in a hierarchical way.
</p>

<p>What I don't like in the classical approach of channel is the way the user
has to specify a particular channel. A typical example, following the log4j
spirit, is to attribute a new channel to a particular <i>software component</i>,
for example, a class:  
</p>

<pre>
class Socket
{
public:
    void OpenConnection();
    void CloseConnection();
    void SendData();
    
private:
    static LogChannel log;
};

LogChannel Socket::log = LogChannel::New( "Socket" );

void Socket::OpenConnection()
{
    log.Trace( "Opening connection" );
}

void Socket::CloseConnection()
{
    log.Trace( "Closing connection" );
}

void Socket::SendData()
{
    log.Trace( "Sending data" );
    if ( /*error*/ )
    {
        log.Error( "Error sending data" );
        return;
    }
}
</pre>

<p>I don't like this usage at all, because you have to write much more
code related to logging (create one channel for each software component),
plus thinking about the channels, their hierarchy, etc...
You also have to wonder, each time you log something, on which channel
you should do it. That "makes you to think".
</p>

<p>So, the first time I discovered this concept, I was not really convinced
about it. For me, it was "a feature that seems poweful, but which is not so much".
This is because I had never had the need of channels, and I was curious to
know what their could be good for. A day, "when looking at Pantheios", I read
a scenario which made me change my mind. Here is a quote of "the original post":
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
I have slightly different requirements for a logging library. I
need to define a hierarchy of logged events, allowing custom grouping and
precise selection.
</p>
<p>
For example, let's say I want to monitor traffic on a FTP site. I want to
be able to switch between the following states (at runtime, of course):
</p>
<ul>
<li>a) all network traffic is logged.</li>
<li>b) network traffic on the control connection is logged.</li>
<li>c) network traffic on the data connection is logged.</li>
<li>d) ...</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Let's say we hav 2 classes, one named <tt>ControlConnection</tt> and the other
<tt>DataConnection</tt>. Both of them use the previous <tt>Socket</tt> class.
</p>

<p>With the classical approach (i.e, the log4j one), each of this class will
create its own channe, for example <tt>Network.Socket</tt>,
<tt>Network.FTP.Control</tt> and <tt>Network.FTP.Data</tt>. This way,
it is possible to easily follow all the network traffic, or just the
network traffic on the control or the data connection.
</p>

<h4>Are channels a good idea in C++?</h4>

<p>It looks nice and poweful. But is it really? I think it is just a
way to filter data depending on their origin (<i>software component</i>).
It could be easy and much simpler to get almost the same result just
by using the source file name as a filtering criteria, as the traditional
way to implement a particular <i>software component</i> component it to
put it in its own translation unit, i.e source file. This concept
of channel just adds the concept of hierarchy, which make it simpler to
the final user to find and filter what he want with a good log viewer.  
</p>

<p>Regarding the final result in the log file, what happen if a socket
can't write the data in the <tt>SendData</tt> function? Then, an error
message will be logged. When you will read it, you will try to guess
on which socket the error occured: the one used by <tt>ControlConnection</tt>
or the one used by <tt>DataConnection</tt>? May be it will be easy to guess,
may be not. But the fact is you have to guess, so it "makes you think".

<p>Why does it makes you think? Because it is impossible at the <tt>Socket</tt>
level to know the kind of data which is send, it depends of the caller.
So, I don't think that creating channels on a  <i>software component</i> is
the best approach, because a <i>software component</i> by itslef
is meaningless, because it will be reused and included in another
<i>software component</i> and become part of it, itself part of another
<i>software component</i>, and so on. <b>The same <i>software component</i>
can have very different contexts depending on its owner/caller</b>.
</p>

<p>So, "in my opinion", a better way to use the concept is to make it possible
to a <i>software component</i> to inherit the channel of its caller, i.e
to split the <i>logging flow</i> in channels instead of the
<i>logging space</i>.
</p>

<p>In Java, I think it is quite difficult to do it. May be you have to change
the constructor of <tt>Socket</tt> so it accepts a channel to log on, and
modify <tt>ControlConnection</tt> and <tt>DataConnection</tt> to pass the
correct channel to their attached socket. In my opinion, this is unacceptable,
because "it introduces the concept of logging in your public interface",
and forces you to "modify you code design to use your logging library".
</p>

<p>In C++, we have deterministic destructors, which already gave us the ability
to develop great concepts like the RAII or "scopped logging". Yet again, they
will be useful to implement <i>execution flow typing</i>. 
</p>

<pre>
void Socket::SendData()
{
    log::trace( "Sending data" );
    if ( /*error*/ )
    {
        log::error( "Error sending data: ..." );
        return;
    }
}

// typing the execution flow in an unsafe way
void ControlConnection::Run()
{
    log::set_channel( "FTP.Control" );
    
    // use the socket 

    log::unset_channel( "FTP.Control" );
}

// typing the execution flow in an safe way
void DataConnection::Run()
{
    // declare a special object which will set the channel
    // in its contructor, and unset it in its destructor
    log_channel channel( "FTP.Data" );
    
    // use the socket 
}
</pre>

<p>By doing do, the socket will be used in 2 different contexts, which
will be identifiable in the log output, even if it is filtered only to
print messages from the <tt>Socket</tt> class (via filtering by file name):
</p>

<pre>
<b>[FTP.Control]   (socket.cpp)    Opening connection
[FTP.Control]   (socket.cpp)    Sending data
[FTP.Control]   (socket.cpp)    Sending data</b>
[FTP.Data]      (socket.cpp)    Opening connection
[FTP.Data]      (socket.cpp)    Sending data
[FTP.Data]      (socket.cpp)    Sending data
<b>[FTP.Control]   (socket.cpp)    Sending data</b>
[FTP.Data]      (socket.cpp)    Opening connection
[FTP.Data]      (socket.cpp)    Sending data
<b>[FTP.Control]   (socket.cpp)    Sending data</b>
[FTP.Data]      (socket.cpp)    Closing connection
<b>[FTP.Control]   (socket.cpp)    Sending data</b>
[FTP.Data]      (socket.cpp)    Sending data
[FTP.Data]      (socket.cpp)    Sending data

<b>[FTP.Control]   (socket.cpp)    Sending data
[FTP.Control]   (socket.cpp)    Sending data</b>
[FTP.Data]      (socket.cpp)    Closing connection

</pre>

<p>Such an output can be easily reformated by a good log viewer
to better highlight each context of use of the socket by using
syntax highlighting as above, or even better, by spliting the
outputs of each execution flow in different views.
</p>

<p>If the channel spliting had been done in the log4j,
and the output was filtered to the <tt>Network.Socket</tt>
channel, then we would have:
</p>

<pre>
[Network.Socket]   (socket.cpp)    Opening connection
[Network.Socket]   (socket.cpp)    Sending data
[Network.Socket]   (socket.cpp)    Sending data

<p>Wich is very redundant to the source file name, and hence useless.
In fact I don't really
understand the advantage of channels.
May be in Java it is a good alternative to getting the source file name
from each logging request, because getting the source file
and the function names of each call to a log function
(through reflection/the thread call stack?) would considerably slow down the application.
But in C++ we can get this informations "for free", so I think
it turns the tide <!-- change la donne-->, and you don't have to deal
with this burden of creating channels in each source file.

If you have a better explanation and a good and realistic
example that can show me the interest, please don't hesitate to
contact me. But before, please, continue to read this article until its ending.
</p>

<p>Because even the above showing how an hypotetical <tt>log_channel</tt>
could be use to add <i>execution context</i> to a particular call, I think
it is not really a good idea, because a good log viewer can automatically
generate a call stack for each log message. 
</p>

<p>For example, take the following:
</p>

<pre>
void Function1()
{
    log_trace() &lt;&lt; "Hello from Function1!\n";
}

void Function2()
{
    log_trace() &lt;&lt; "Calling Function1\n";
    Function1();
    log_trace() &lt;&lt; "It worked!\n";
}

void Function3()
{
    log_trace() &lt;&lt; "Calling Function2\n";
    Function2();
}
<pre>

<pre>
If the logging library uses macros, it can transparently instanciate
a local object for each log request, in order to do "scope logging".
For example, the above code could be expanded in something like:
</pre>

<pre>
class scope_logger
{
public:
    scope_logger( const char *FileName, const char *FuncName ):
        file_name( FileName ),
        func_name( FuncName )
    {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; "ENTER: [" &lt;&lt; this->file_name
            &lt;&lt; "]{" &lt;&lt; this->file_name  &lt;&lt; "}\n";
    }
    ~scope_logger()
    {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; "LEAVE: [" &lt;&lt; this->file_name
            &lt;&lt; "]{" &lt;&lt; this->file_name  &lt;&lt; "}\n";
    }
private:
    const char *file_name;
    const char *func_name;
};

void Function1()
{
    scope_logger scoper_line23(__FILE__, __FUNCTION__); std::cout &lt;&lt; "Hello from Function1!\n";
}

void Function2()
{
    scope_logger scoper_line28(__FILE__, __FUNCTION__); std::cout &lt;&lt; "Calling Function1\n";
    Function1();
    scope_logger scoper_line30(__FILE__, __FUNCTION__); std::cout &lt;&lt; "It worked!\n";
}

void Function3()
{
    scope_logger scoper_line35(__FILE__, __FUNCTION__); std::cout &lt;&lt; "Calling Function2\n";
}
<pre>

<p>Which would output:
</p>

<pre>
ENTER: [D:/example/test.cpp]{Function3}
Calling Function2
ENTER: [D:/example/test.cpp]{Function2}
Calling Function1
ENTER: [D:/example/test.cpp]{Function1}
Hello from Function1!
LEAVE: [D:/example/test.cpp]{Function1}
ENTER: [D:/example/test.cpp]{Function2}
It worked!
LEAVE: [D:/example/test.cpp]{Function2}
LEAVE: [D:/example/test.cpp]{Function2}
LEAVE: [D:/example/test.cpp]{Function3}
</pre>

<p>A good lof viewer could then easily rebuild the call stack, by eliminating
the redundant ENTER and LEAVE 
</p>

<pre>
Calling Function2 (test.cpp)
> Calling Function1 (test.cpp)
  > Hello from Function1! (test.cpp)
> It worked! (test.cpp)
</pre>

<p>The <tt>scope_logger</tt> can be optimized in many way. This is discussed
in "scope logging".
</p>

<p>By doing so, we do not get the exact call stack. But, do we need it?
The basic assumption is the following: if we want to have information about
the execution of particular piece of code, we put some logging code in it.
If think it is reasonable to say that the logging library will only ouput
information of code for which it was asked for, i.e for which logging requests
were writen.
</p>

<p>However, there is a flaw in this design. In the following example:
<p>

<pre>
void Function1()
{
    log_trace() &lt;&lt; "Hello from Function1!\n";
}

void Function2()
{
    Function1();
    log_trace() &lt;&lt; "Function2 succeeded!\n";
}
</pre>

<p>
The logging library will miss the fact that <tt>Function1()</tt> was
called from within <tt>Function2()</tt>, and will output:
</p>

<pre>
Hello from Function1! (test.cpp)
Function2 succeeded! (test.cpp)
</pre>

<p>
I don't have any magic solution for this issue, just some ideas:  
</p>

<ul>
<li>A very good log viewer
could parse the source code of the given file in order to bind the line
number with a function name. I think this is very difficult to do, and also
to use, because the exact source code must be available.</li>
<li>A less complex way could be to log the address of the current
instruction pointer (eip on x86). Then, given the map file outputed
by the linker, it should be possible to bind a particular address
with a function name, even without using __FUNCTION__ not __FILE__.</li>
<li>If the program is compiled in Debug and/or its symbols are 
available (not striped), it should even be possible to do the same
without using a map file.</li>
<li>Using some specific compiler extensions can help to do more.
For example, the VC++ <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/64ez38eh(VS.80).aspx">_ReturnAddress</a>
intrinsic can give a way to know the address where this function
was called from, hence give a way to know its name by using one of the
above techniques</li>
</ul>

<p>
So, there is not easy way to solve this, and it can't be reasonabily done
in real-time, i.e for synchronous logging. So, the only solution I see
is to ask the developer "to solve this problem for us", by informing him
of this issue and giving the recomandation to always put a logging
instruction at the (almost) beggining of a function, if there are other
logging instructions inside. We can also provide a <tt>log_scope</tt>
macro is the programmer does not know what to log:
</p>

<pre>
void Function1()
{
    log_trace() &lt;&lt; "Hello from Function1!\n";
}

void Function2()
{
    log_scope(); // does nothing more than instanciating a scope_logger
    Function1();
    log_trace() &lt;&lt; "Function2 succeeded!\n";
}
</pre>

<p>This requierement breaks my so loved rule of "asking the user to
solve a design issue". However, because I am the one who dicted this
rule, I am also the one who can violate it without worrying too much :-)
</p>

<p>More seriously, I think it can be acceptable, for several reasons.
First, it does not affect the way you log code, it is just an extra
to help you to better understand the log output. You can still choose
the classic flat log output if this issue embarass you. You can also
easily deactivate it by redifining the log macros.
Then, this need to put something related to loggin at the beggining
of your functions can be easily done with the help of other useful
macros.
</p>

<p>For example, the <tt>assert</tt> macro can be modified to instanciate
a <tt>scope_logger</tt>:
</p>

<pre>
void Function1()
{
    log_trace() &lt;&lt; "Hello from Function1!\n";
}

void Function2( int *P )
{
    assert( P );
    
    Function1();
    log_trace() &lt;&lt; "Function2 succeeded!\n";
}
</pre>

<p>It is also possible to use a replacement macro mapped
to the logging library, like "the <tt>verify</tt> macro": 
</p>

<pre>
void Function1()
{
    log_trace() &lt;&lt; "Hello from Function1!\n";
}

void Function2( int *P )
{
    verify( P ) &lt;&lt; "P is null!";
    
    Function1();
    log_trace() &lt;&lt; "Function2 succeeded!\n";
}
</pre>

<p>If you use such a macro to do error detection in your code,
especially to validate the given parameters, then it will
greatly improve the reliability of the reconstructed call stack.
