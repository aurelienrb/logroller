<h3>What is logging good for</h3>

<p>According to the different sources, we can identify several
ways people want to access the data of the log file:
</p>

<ul>
<li>instant reading (output in a console for example) : tracing, live debugging...</li>
<li>delayed reading (consult the log file at the end of execution for example) : performance analysis, ...</li>
<li>error diagnostic (dump a file if an error occured, like a crash) : post-mortem analysis, ...</li>
</ul>

<p>We can also identify different purpose of logging:
</p>


<p>Regarding the way data needs to be filtered:
</p>

<ul>
<li>filtering is done by the application itself at compile time</li>
<li>filtering is done by the application itself at runtime time</li>
<li>the application do no filtering, it is optionaly done by another tool when
consulting the log data (log viewer, SQL request,...)</li>
</ul>

<p>Regarding the way data needs to be saved:
</p>

<ul>
<li>no need to save data (console output...)</li>
<li>save data only on some condition</li>
<li>always save data</li>
</ul>

<p>People also have many different needs regarding the place log data should
be saved:
</p>

<ul>
<li>several files for a single process (error.log, warning.log, ...)</li>
<li>one file for one single process</li>
<li>one file for all the instances of a same application (webserver)</li>
<li>centralized logging from different sources (database, system logger, logserver)</li>
</ul>

<h4>special considerations regarding postmortem logs</h4>
<p>Generating a postmortem log can be verry difficult, because it often has to
be done in the context of a crash, that is a dying application.
The memory can be completely corrupted, or it can be full and the system is
running under very low ressource, etc... Handling such problems should be
of the responsibility of the crash handler (like setting up a new stack in case
of a stack overflow), but a well designed logging library should allows she crash
handler to dump as much information as possible, without running into trouble.
</p>

<h4>special considerations regarding log saving and sending</h4>
<p>When generating post execution logs in the context of an open source software
or in teh context of debugging a closed source software within the developpement
team, there is almost no restriction regarding the type of information that can be
put in the log file.
</p>

<p>However, people developping closed source software may worry about the type
of information that is dumped in the log file at the client side. In particular,
they might not appreciate that anyone can read all the logged messages, as well
as the source file and function names, etc...
</p>

<p>The perfect logging library should also have this in mind, and provide an
easy way to dump the data in a non human readable format.
