<h3>Logging in a multithreaded context</h3>

<p>A modern logging library must be thread safe, and must provide a way to
know from which thread a log message was generated. By thread safety, I mean
in the way the library is implemented of course, but also in the way messages
are outputed. Each logging message request should be atomic, and processed
in its order of arrival. For example, if thread1 begins to generate a log
message, then is interupted by thread2 which also generate a log message,
then the message of thread1 should appear as logged first. I call this
<i>atomic logging</i>. 
</p>

<p>Thread are likely to generate different messages "at the same time".
In some scenario, it can be an issue. For example, if the messages are
directly outputed to a console or to a file, the writing of a message
by one thread my be interrupted by another one, which will write its
own message at the same moment, thus generating some incomprehensive
output. A typical example of this is the following output:
</p>

<pre>
Message from thread1
Message from thread1
Message from thread2
Message froMessage from thread1
m thread2
</pre>

<p>One easy way to solve is to attach to each thread its own output.
For example, each thread may output its messages in its own file.
In the case of logging messages are appended to a log buffer, each
thread can be attached to itw own, private buffer.
This solution has the advantage to eliminate the need of synchronisation,
hence reducing the work needed to implement thread safety, solving the
problem of external dependency (to introduce the concept of threads in your
library you need to use some platform specific calls, or an external portable
library like boost.threads, pthread, ...). It is also faster to run, because
the is no thread synchronisation, and thus one thread is never blocked by another
one because of the use of your logging library (this can be an unexpected
behaviour by your customers, and it should be documented). 
</p>

<p>In some certain circonstancies, using a single global output does not
affect <i>message atomicity</i>, because the output manages thread safety
itself. For example, if messages are logged into a database, several
thread can log their own message without worrying about each others, because
the ordering and the atomocity of log requests are delayed to the database.
However, the logging library must do the necessary to ensure log requests
will be stored in the same order they where first started. This mean that you
can not first generate the SQL request from the given message to log and
then execute this request. You must first lock the database as soon as you
where asked for, build the log message to insert, and then execute the insert
statement.  
</p>

<p>So, giving each thread its own output (file, buffer, ...) when applicable
(not the case of the console, of a socket, ...) may seem very convenient. We
can imagine such a syntax:
</p>

<pre>
void thread_proc1()
{
    logger *log = init_logger( "thread1.txt" );
    log->append( "Message from thread1" );
}

void thread_proc2()
{
    logger *log = init_logger( "thread2.txt" );
    log->append( "Message from thread2" );
}
</pre>

<p>While practical, this approach raise the following question:
who will close the file? Or the more generalized one:
Who is responsible of releasing the resource attributed to each thread?
</p>

<p>The obvious answer is "the one who allocated it", i.e the thread itself.
But I personally think that giving each thread the responsability to 
release the resource it was attached to is not a good idea.
</p>

<p>First, it not an easy thing to do. Don't forget we want to use logging in 
a robust software developing context. A thread can easily "forget" to do this, 
because it was exited at some point (by a call to pthread_exit or ExitThread
for example), or because it did something wrong (like dereferencing a NULL pointer)
and was killed by the system, or simply because it was killed by anothed thread
(TerminateThread) which is known as being a bad practice, but not by everyone
and so it exists and a good logging library should consider that.
(see the rule "safely usable by a complete C++ beginner").
</p>

<p>An other problem with this approach is: what about accessing the thread logging
contents after the thread ended? If each thread manage its own resource, how can
we know at the process level where the logged message went? If the messages where
stored in an internal buffer for possible later dumping, what about accessing
the contents of this buffer after the thread exited?  
</p>

<p>An alternative way to "solve" this is to change "the one who allocated it".
This could be the creator of the thread, i.e the main() function.
</p>

<pre>
void thread_proc1(void *Ptr)
{
    logger_output *output = (logger*)logger_output;    
    logger *log = init_logger( output );
    log->append( "Message from thread1" );
}

void thread_proc2(void *Ptr)
{
    logger_output *output = (logger*)logger_output;    
    logger *log = init_logger( output );
    log->append( "Message from thread2" );
}
</pre>

<p>The main() function would allocate and initialize one logger_output
for each thread, and decide when to release them. But, that's the
question: when to release them?
</p>

<p>
Depending of the context, it can be difficult for the main() function
to detect a thread ended. It mostly depends of the used thread library,
and the architecture of the application. In an  event driven application
such as a GUI program developped with Qt, it is quite easy to be informed
that a thread ended (by connecting a slot to the correct signal from QThread).
</p>

<p>However, in many other circumstances, the only way to know a thread ended
is by polling, i.e frequently testing if each started thread is still alive
or not. By doind so, the function main() can detect the end of each thread,
append a message of the type "Thread1 ended normally" or
"Thread2 was killed by the system (ACCESS_VIOLATION)". But polling is bad,
and it is an unacceptable solution in the contect of a logging library.
Because I think such a task of allocating and closing the per-thread ressource
+ informing a thread exited should be done transparently by the logging library.
And with the polling approach, that would mean doing polling each time the user
call the library, i.e each time he logs a message.. 
</p>

<p>Yet another option is to use another thread dedicated to thread ending
detection, in a correct passive way. This is how Qt safely detects the ending of
a thread (inclusing abnormal terminaison), by starting a "watcher thread"
which is responsible of tracking the launched threads.  
</p>

<p>This way, a logging library could automatically handle resource allocation on
a per thread basis, safely handle the deallocation and safely detect almost in
real-time the endind of a thread (quickly outputing a log message about the ending)
of a thread can be an interesting feature).
</p>


<p>This way, each thread can safely use its own private resource, whithout being
slowed down nor interupted by global synchronisation mechanism.
</p>

<p>But is it as good as it seems to be?
</p>

<p>First, it is no so easy to implement, because you need to be informed
of each thread creation. This can be automatically detected by testing if
the current thread id is a known one, but such a test can be difficult to
implement in an efficient way. A better solution would rely on TLS.
So, you have to implement an automatic initialisation technique based on
the use of TLS, then to implement a watcher thread, i.e use particular system
calls and dealing with the complexity and the limitation of TLS.  
</p>

<p>Then you have to take care of many multi-threading issues. For example,
some implementation of memory management in C++ (new/delete of your compiler)
can automatically release the undeleted memory of a thread when the later ends.
So if you use some memory allocated via new in your library (which can be
easily done if you use std::string for example), you may run
into troubles if you try to access it after the thread ended. 
The watcher thread could also die or be killed.
</p>

<p>This is in fact very simple: the one who free a particular resource should
be the one who allocated it. So, if your library does automatic initialisation
from a thread, the unitilisation has to be done from that thread, and we saw
it is not possible to implement that in a robust way.
</p>

<p>That's why I think the logging library should not need any per-thread
initialiation. Said in other words, I don't think the per-thread resource
approach is the best one. 
</p>

<p>Having a global resource shared by all the thread is a much simpler approach,
and it does not have so much drawbacks compared to the per-thread approach. 
</p>

<p>First, it also has its own strong points the per-thread approach does't have.
Because all the lg messages are centralized in the same place, in the order they
where asked to do (multiplexage/ordering?), it is possible to follow and compare the
execution flow of the different threads, while still being possible to easily
separate each thread output with the proper tool.
</p>

<p>In some case, it can be usefull to know if a particular log message from
a thread was or no outputed before or after another message from another thread.
The global resource way makes this possible, not the per-thread (I mean, in
a very accurate way). 
</p>

<p>Then, one of the bigger advantage of the per-thread approach is the lower
impact regarding the scheduling of the threads. At first sight, it seems that
outputing a log message will not generate a context switch for the calling
thread, nor slow down its execution because of the use of an heavy
synchronisation mecanism (like a semaphore). 
</p>

<p>The fact is, first, outputing a log message can still trigger a context
switch. A poorly written logging library may even do this almost each time.
Logging a message may induce some system (calls for allocating memory,
writing data to a file, etc...) wich will interupt the thread.
Any use of the standard library of your compiler may also do the same,
because the thread-safe library given with your compiler may do some
internal use of synchronisation mechanism.  
</p>

<p>Then, there are several way to implement synchronisation betweend threads,
and some of them are very efficient (critical sections) because they do
not use kernel object (like a semaphore), and because it is possible to
safely access shared memory with the use of some dedicated processor
instructions. So, a well designed library might be able to implement
a thread-safe logging architecture that does not necesseraly indue a context
switch from the caller thread, and which is able to handle message creation
in a centralized way almost as fast than a per-thread way (see below,
"special considerations").
</p>

<p>Finally, most of the time, people want to be able to read all the log
messages in real time in the same output, like a console. So, you will need
to implement <i>message atomicity</i> and even more <i>message ordering</i>
even if your achitecture is designed not to need this.
</p>

<h4>Special consideration regarding message ordering</h4>
<p>
In order to implement correct <i>message ordering</i> in a centralized approach,
you must separate 2 concepts:
</p>

<ul>
<li>allocation of the message number</li>
<li>creation of the message itself</li>
</ul>

<p>The allocation of the message number should be done as early as possible.
For example, in the following example:
</p>

<pre>
std::string get_hello_world()
{
    return "Hello World!";
}

log( "New message: ", get_hello_world() );
</pre>

<p>The creation of the message will begin before the message number is
generated, because we call a function, which construct a std:string object, etc.
</p>

<p>The consequence is: if an other thread executes an other log operation when
your first thread is still inside <tt>get_hello_world()</tt>, it may output
its message before the first thread, which began the log operation first.
So, the message from the second thread will be wrongly reported as generated
before the one of the first thread.
</p>

<p>That's another reason why I prefer the C++ stream syntax. In the folowing
example:
</p>

<pre>
std::string get_hello_world()
{
    return "Hello World!";
}

log() &lt;&lt; "New message: " &lt;&lt; get_hello_world();
</pre>

<p>With this syntax, the first fucntion which is called is not
<tt>get_hello_world()</tt> but <tt>log()</tt>, making it possible to allocate
the message number before cosntructing the message itself. The end of the
construction of the message can be done by the destructor of the stream
returned by <tt>log()</tt>.
</p>

<p>This way, <i>message ordering</i> can be done in a much more accurate way.
It is still possible to another thread to log a message if the above thread
was interupted just in the moment  <tt>log()</tt> began to execute, but this is
a really particular case that most people don't care about. 
</p>

<p>The C++ stream syntax also give the assurance that a loging operation
will not be missed because an exception occured during the creation of the
message, if <tt>get_hello_world()</tt> triggers an exception for example.
If such a thing happens, the second library would still log the
"New message: " message, while the first one will completely be uninformed
of the failed log request. For more information, see "Which syntax to use?".
