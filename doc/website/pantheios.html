<h3>Pantheios review</h3> 

<p>
In the "jungle of C++ logging libraries", very few of them are really
mature and really used by the C++ community. Pantheios is one of them.
</p>

<p>Pantheios is quite interesting to study, because it is a successful
library which is not related to "the log4j sphere", and which was developped
with C and C++ in mind. It was first developped by
<a href="http://www.synesis.com.au">Synesis Software</a>,
by Matthew Wilson, "with contributions, opinions and advice by Garth Lancaster".
It was then <a href="http://www.synesis.com.au/news.html#pantheios">forked out of the Synesis Software code base in 2005</a>,
as an open source project:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
We believe that this open-source logging API library represents the ultimate
combination of atomicity, genericity, efficiency, extensibility, portability,
and type-safety and, best of all, it upholds the Spirit of C: you only pay
for what you use.
</p>
<p>
The unique design means that Pantheios incurs virtually no cost when logging
(of a particular severity level) is switched off. The <a href = "http://pantheios.org/performance.html">performance tests</a>
conducted thus far indicate that the performance features of Pantheios
outstrip those of any other logging library by a considerable margin.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Before going further, I think it is useful to look at the main author's
profile. Matthew Wilson is a true C++ expert, who
<a href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=102861">describes him self</a> as this
(in 2005):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
My experience is roughly 12 years C/C++, with a strong focus on 
high-performance/communications systems, and mixed languages/technologies.
<br />
(...)<br />
<br />
Although I'm wont to flights of template-programming fancy, I'm primarily a pragmatist, and
am constantly on the lookout for ways to simplify people's use of C++.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Matthew Wilson wrotes <a href="http://www.synesis.com.au/articles.html">a huge
number of articles</a> for <a href="http://www.cuj.com/">C/C++ User's Journal/Dr Dobb's Journal</a>,
<a href="http://www.artima.com/cppsource">The C++ Source (artima)</a>,
<a href="http://www.byte.com/">BYTE</a>,
<a href="http://www.wd-mag.com/">Windows Developer Magazine</a>, and some others.
He is also the authors 2 C++ books,
<a href="http://imperfectcplusplus.com/">Imperfect C++</a> and
the recent <a href="http://extendedstl.com/">Extended STL, volume 1: Collections and Iterators</a>.
</p>

<p>Last, but not least, he is also involved in
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/users/matsys/">many open source projects</a>,
in particular the <a href="http://synesis.com.au/software/stlsoft/">STLSoft library</a>,
which is used by Pantheios and is needed to build and use the logging library.
</p>

<p>Pantheios is also one the rare logging library which became successful and popular,
and one of the only one which can compete the official "log4j" port, i.e "log4cxx".
It is also one of the rare library which is still in development, and for which
new versions are planned soon.
So Matthew managed to make Pantheios a successful project, which is not an easy
task as the "list of totaly unknown project" show it.
So we should consider it with respect and attention.
</p>

<h4>Pantheios at a glance</h4>

<p>When you browse the Pantheios documentation, you can fell how much importance
the author gives to performance. He spent a long time to write
<a href="http://pantheios.sourceforge.net/performance.html#sweet-spot">benchmarks</a>
which highlight the quite good performance of its library in general, but more
especially the <i>unmeasurably low impact on performance when logging
(of a given severity level) is switched off</i>. In my opinion, it is the essence
of this project, and why it was born. So, the first conclusion we can do
is: 
</p>

<h4>for some people, the performance of the logging library when logging
is switched off is critical</h4>

<p>For me, it was quite weird to discover this main concern, as it almost
means "how fast is your library if I don't use it?".
</p>

<p>When you see the surprising overheads of Pantheios competitors when
logging is turned off, you are also curious to understand how this is
possible since some of them are supposed to use some macro magic to
remove all the logging code at compile time, an hence they should also
have an <i>unmeasurably low impact</i>. Why is it not the case, and
what does Pantheios special which correct it?
</p>

<p>The answer is simple, by "switching logging of", Matthew means doing
it "at run-time". It was not obvious for me, as in my conception of
logging, you care of logging performance only for the release version,
which you build without activating some levels, "at compile time".
So, the previous conclusion can be corrected to:
</p>

<h4>for some people, the ability to switch off some logging levels at
run-time and have an unmeasurably low impact for this hiden levels
is critical</h4>

<p>So, Pantheios is an "ordered levels oriented library", with a particular
focus on the efficiency of "run-time filtering".
</p>

<h4>Pantheios syntax</h4>

<p>Although Pantheios is quite well documented, there is no real
simple tutorial showing a basic example. Fortunatly, there are numerous
examples in the source code, which give a first taste of the library.
I choose the "example_cpp_file.cpp":
</p>

<pre>
/* Pantheios Header Files */
#include &lt;pantheios/pantheios.hpp>          // Pantheios C++ main header
#include &lt;pantheios/inserters/args.hpp>     // for pantheios::args

#include &lt;pantheios/backends/bec.file.h>    // be.file header

/* Standard C/C++ Header Files */
#include &lt;exception>                        // for std::exception
#include &lt;string>                           // for std::string
#include &lt;stdlib.h>                         // for exit codes

/* ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// */

// Define the fe.simple process identity, so that it links if using fe.simple
PANTHEIOS_EXTERN_C const char   FE_SIMPLE_PROCESS_IDENTITY[]    =   "example_cpp_file";

/* ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// */

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  try
  {
    pantheios::log_DEBUG("main(", pantheios::args(argc, argv), ")");

    pantheios::log_NOTICE("stmt 1");

    // Set the file name for the local back-end, truncating the 
    // file's existing contents, if any.
    pantheios_be_file_setFileName("log.local", PANTHEIOS_BE_FILE_F_TRUNCATE, PANTHEIOS_BEID_LOCAL);

    pantheios::log_NOTICE("stmt 2");

    // Set the file name for the remote back-end.
    pantheios_be_file_setFileName("log.remote", 0, PANTHEIOS_BEID_REMOTE);

    pantheios::log_NOTICE("stmt 3");

    // Set the file name for all back-ends.
    pantheios_be_file_setFileName("log.all", 0);

    pantheios::log_NOTICE("stmt 4");

    pantheios::log_DEBUG("exiting main()");

    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
  }
  catch(std::bad_alloc &)
  {
    pantheios::log_CRITICAL("out of memory");
  }
  catch(std::exception &x)
  {
    pantheios::log_ALERT("Exception: ", x);
  }
  catch(...)
  {
    pantheios::puts(pantheios::emergency, "Unexpected unknown error");
  }

  return EXIT_FAILURE;
}
</pre>

<p>Surprinsgly, Pantheios is not macro based. There is only
a couple of "variadic macros", which are so not available on all compilers.
I see here a big problem: the macro interface of Pantheios is not portable.
I think it is a very serious limitation, because someone may use these macros
to develop a big project, and a day, they will try to port it on another
system with a different compiler which does not support variadic macros,
and all their logging code will break. I think that the public API of a
logging library should only use "standard C++".
</p>

<p>This is because Pantheios uses a kind of "C style loggin syntax", which
"does not easily permit compile-time filtering". As a consequence,
variadic macros where introduced in order to try to "correct a design flaw",
and the result is worst, because compile time filtering is available on some
systems, and not on some others, making Pantheios usage non portable, while
Pantheios is originally highly portable. As a result, I consider Pantheios
does not implement compile time filtering, and does not provide a
"macro based API".
</p>

<p>However, it should be possible to "use a macro trick" to correct this.
</p>

<h4>What about the ease of use</h4>

<p>So, Pantheios does not have a valuable "macro based API", so Pantheios can not
automatically log the file name and the line number for you.
However, if you use the variadic macros, it does. It will insert a "prefix"
before your log message, which is by default the file name in C, and the file name +
the line number in C++. You are free to define you own prefix (interesting feature):
</p>

<pre>
#define PANTHEIOS_STRINGIZE_(x)     #x
#define PANTHEIOS_STRINGIZE(x)      PANTHEIOS_STRINGIZE_(x)

 /* Define the defaults here, in case we use them below. */
# define PANTHEIOS_FILELINE_A                   __FILE__ "(" PANTHEIOS_STRINGIZE(__LINE__) "): "
# define PANTHEIOS_FILELINE                     PANTHEIOS_FILELINE_A

 /* Now define the prefix, if the user has not already done so. */
# if !defined(PANTHEIOS_TRACE_PREFIX)
#  define PANTHEIOS_TRACE_PREFIX                PANTHEIOS_FILELINE
#  ifdef __cplusplus
#   define PANTHEIOS_TRACE_LOG_PREFIX           ::pantheios::pan_slice_t(PANTHEIOS_FILELINE, STLSOFT_NUM_ELEMENTS(PANTHEIOS_FILELINE) - 1)
#  else /* ? __cplusplus */
#   define PANTHEIOS_TRACE_LOG_PREFIX           PANTHEIOS_FILELINE
#  endif /* __cplusplus */
# else /* ? PANTHEIOS_TRACE_PREFIX */
#  define PANTHEIOS_TRACE_LOG_PREFIX            PANTHEIOS_TRACE_PREFIX
# endif /* !PANTHEIOS_TRACE_PREFIX */
</pre>

<p>As you can see, the C++ code uses an unknown <tt>pan_slice_t</tt> object.
The doc says:
</p>

<blockquote>
This structure represents a character string as a slice,
in the form of a pointer to the first character, and a count
of the number of characters in the slice.
</blockquote>

<p>It is a little more than a stupid wrapper of char *, which
introduce a concept of "lazy length", which is not very well documented.
It also just hold a pointer to the char string, and does not do any
allocation or copy. In fact, its just a way to associate a
<tt>const char *</tt> with its lebngth.
</p>

<p>So, thanks to the PANTHEIOS_TRACE_LOG_PREFIX macro, there is no extra memory
allocation if you want to log the file name, by using the variadic macros,
of by writing for example:
</p>

<pre>
pantheios::log_NOTICE( PANTHEIOS_TRACE_LOG_PREFIX, "Hello World!" );
</pre>

<p>However, what about if a "dummy user" did not look at the source code
(the existence of PANTHEIOS_TRACE_LOG_PREFIX is not documented), and writes:
</p>

<pre>
pantheios::log_NOTICE( __FILE__, "Hello World!" );
</pre>

<p>Then, the proper template function <tt>log_NOTICE</tt> will be instanciated,
depending on the given argument number:
</p>

<pre>
template&lt;typename T0>
inline int log_NOTICE(T0 const& v0);

template&lt;typename T0, typename T1>
inline int log_NOTICE(T0 const  &v0, T1 const& v1);

template&lt;typename T0, typename T1, typename T2>
inline int log_NOTICE(T0 const  &v0, T1 const& v1, T2 const& v2);

template&lt;typename T0, typename T1, typename T2, typename T3>
inline int log_NOTICE(T0 const  &v0, T1 const& v1, T2 const& v2, T3 const& v3);

// And so on...
</pre>

<p>There are 32 different <tt>log_NOTICE</tt> defined like this.
All the <tt>log_XXX</tt> follow the same schema, ie <tt>log_EMERGENCY</tt>,
<tt>log_ALERT</tt>, <tt>log_CRITICAL</tt>, <tt>log_ERROR</tt>,
<tt>log_WARNING</tt>, <tt>log_NOTICE</tt>, <tt>log_INFORMATIONAL</tt>
and <tt>log_DEBUG</tt>.
</p>

<p>This task is handled by a Ruby script, which can be modified to
generated a different number of function of each level, or to introduce
a new level.
</p>

<p>All this 256 template functions do almost the same: they
"filter" (i.e do nothing) the log request if their corresponding
level is switched off, otherwise they "dispatch" the given arguments to the macro
<tt>PANTHEIOS_INVOKE_SHIM_PAIR_</tt>, which is defined like this:
</p>

<pre>
# define PANTHEIOS_INVOKE_SHIM_PAIR_(x)     c_str_len_a(x), c_str_data_a(x)
</pre>

<p>where <tt>x</tt> is one argument given to <tt>log_NOTICE</tt>,
and <tt>c_str_len_a</tt> and <tt>c_str_data_a</tt> are functions from
the STLSoft library
</p>

<p>The "dispatching" operation will then generate a <tt>pan_slice_t</tt> object
from the given "shim pair"., and will finally be passed to the main logging
function of Pantheios core:
</p>

<pre>
PANTHEIOS_CALL(int) pantheios_log_n(    pan_sev_t                       severity
                                    ,   size_t                          numSlices
                                    ,   pantheios::pan_slice_t const*   slices);
                                    ,   pan_slice_t const*              slices);
</pre>

<p>The weird thing is that if the given object is already a <tt>pan_slice_t</tt>,
it will still be split by the <tt>c_str_len_a</tt> and <tt>c_str_data_a</tt>
functions overloaded by Pantheios in order to recognize its type
<tt>pan_slice_t</tt> (that STLSoft doesn't know):
</p>

<pre>
/** \brief Returns a nul-terminated non-NULL C-style string representing the slice */
inline char const* c_str_ptr(pan_slice_t const& s)
{
    return s.ptr;
}

/** \brief Returns a possibly non-nul-terminated non-NULL C-style string representing the slice */
inline char const* c_str_data_a(pan_slice_t const& s)
{
    return c_str_ptr(s);
}

/** \brief Returns the number of characters in the length of the C-style string representing the slice */
inline size_t c_str_len_a(pan_slice_t const& s)
{
    return s.len;
}
</pre>

<p>And another one new <tt>pan_slice_t</tt> object (the same one in fact) will
be generated. But the design of Pantheios make it difficult not to do so.
We can hope the compiler will be able to optimize that, "which is something
I like to think".
</p>

<p>The <tt>pantheios_log_n</tt> is the real entry point into the core of
Pantheios. It creates an <tt>stlsoft::auto_buffer</tt> where all
all the given <tt>pan_slice_t</tt> will by concatenated and stored
This is done in one call to <tt>std::copy</tt> by giving it a
<tt>stlsoft::cstring_concatenator_iterator</tt>, which will in fine
call <tt>memcpy</tt>.
</p>

<p>The <tt>auto_buffer</tt> will try to allocate enought memory on the stack,
and will use the heap otherwise. After having been filled, this buffer
is given to <tt>pantheios_be_logEntry</tt>, and that's it
for the core of Pantheios, because as the previous function name suggests it
(<tt>pantheios_<b>be</b>_logEntry</tt>), we are jumping to the "back end" code.
</p>

<p>When the back end function returns, the memory is released. So, Pantheios
is a "synchronous logging library". Because the core anly see and understands
chunks of text (<tt>pan_slice_t</tt>), which also makes it "type safe",
all the formatting must be done at
"the source code level", including the "trace prefix" ("header"). 
</p>

<p>So, at this stage, the rest of the overhead of the library depends of
the back end, which "has the hability to slow down or crash the library".
Hoerver, the call to <tt>pantheios_be_logEntry</tt> is guarded by a
<tt>try...catch</tt> block in order not to propagate a thrown exception.
</p>

<h4>What about the ease of use</h4>

<p>Pantheios says about itself it is "simple to use and extend".
In my opinion, this is not really the case.
</p>

<p>The first thing that really chocked me is the following line:
</p>

<pre>
// Define the fe.simple process identity, so that it links if using fe.simple
PANTHEIOS_EXTERN_C const char   FE_SIMPLE_PROCESS_IDENTITY[]    =   "example_cpp_file";
</pre>

<blockquote>
The application must define this variable, to contain the application name/identity.
</blockquote>


<p>This has to be done in all program using Pantheios (CONFIRM), in order
not to have a link error (unresolved external symbol FE_SIMPLE_PROCESS_IDENTITY).
</p>

<p>I think for a "dummy", the link error is the worst one. It is even more
embarassing than a nested template error, because there is no source file
incrimined, and also because many beginners have difficulties to make the
dsitinction between declaration/definition and the concept of linkage.
</p>

<p>So I think to impose to define such a definition in order to link the
program is not a good thing. That's even more wierd that Pantheios
automaticcally handles the inclusion of some library files.
</p>

<p>Regarding the ease of extend, I don't agree neither. I think what the author
means by "extend" is to add its own back end. But I think the first thing
people want to customize is the syntax and the choice of levels.
And changing the predefined levels / adding a new one is not something easy.
It is not so difficult, but it is not as simple as "defining a new constant",
because the user also has to edit the Ruby script and use it to regenerate
some files. May be it is flexible, but not very convenient. 
</p>

<h4>Exception safety</h4>

<h4>Thread safety</h4>

<h4>Users feedback</h4>

<p>Users can send feedbacks about Pantheios on the "stfsoft mailinglist".
Few of them did, which is still more than for many others logging libraries.
The author of "Simple Log" "take to mean that nobody needs
help in order to make it work".
One of the reported problem with Pantheios was causing conflicts with Insure++,
a code analysis tool. This illustrates the "cost of a logging library". 
</p>

<p>A user also do a feature request, where he expose his "usage of logging":
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
I have slightly different requirements for a logging library. I
need to define a hierarchy of logged events, allowing custom grouping and
precise selection.
</p>
<p>
For example, let's say I want to monitor traffic on a FTP site. I want to
be able to switch between the following states (at runtime, of course):
</p>
<ul>
<li>a) all network traffic is logged.</li>
<li>b) network traffic on the control connection is logged.</li>
<li>c) network traffic on the data connection is logged.</li>
<li>d) ...</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a concrete example of the need of "channels". Pantheios does not
implement them
