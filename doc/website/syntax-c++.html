<h3>Choosing a logging syntax in C++</h3>

<img src="images/291498_integral_calculations.jpg" width="150" heigh="100" />

<p>I found many many various logging libraries or C++, but I didn't find a smuch
ways to write a log request. There is, in fact, only 2 known principle way to do it:
</p>

<img src="images/617303_sack_racer.jpg" width="150" heigh="112" />

<h3>The standard function syntax</h3>

<h4>The printf way</h4>

<p>One of the most used syntax is a syntax similar to the standard C 
function printf. The C and C++ languages allows a function to have a variable
number of parameters. To do this, you use an ellipsis, as in the following example:
</p>

<pre>void log( const char *Format, ... );
</pre>

<p>This is the very tipical way to do it. The first parameter (which is mandated
by the langage in order to use an ellipsis) is used to tell the function log
2 things: the number of parameters, and the type of each of them.
</p>

<p>Such a log fucntion could be use, for example, like this:
</p>

<pre>void Test( const char * Msg )
{
    log( "Message from file %s, line %d: %s", __FILE__, __LINE__, Msg );
}
</pre>

<p>In its implementation, the log function will use some special macros
(varrag, valist) to iterate over the list of given parameters.
There is no way, at the language level, to know how many parameters
were given, not the type of each of them. So, the log fucntion has
no other choice than to trust the caller who tells her that there is
a first parameter of type string (%s), and a second one of type integer (%d). 
</p>

<p>Note that the "string type" is in the C way, i.e a null terminated char array.
If the programmer changes his function prototype to the following:
</p>

<pre>void Test( const std::string & Msg )
{
    log( "Message from file %s, line %d: %s", __FILE__, __LINE__, Msg );
}
</pre>

<p>whithout modifying the logging request, the code will still compile.
But an error may occur at run-time, as the log function will blindly
cast the given std::string to a const char *, and try to print it.
</p>

<p>An other very stupid example is when you want to modify the order
of the outputed parameters, and forget to synchronise the format string
with the parameters list:  
</p>

<pre>void Test( const char * Msg )
{
    log( "Message: %s [file %s, line %d]", __FILE__, __LINE__, Msg );
}
</pre>

<p>So, in C++, no need to say I totally and completly disagree with this
approach, because there are, in my opinion, so much problems with it:
</p>

<ul>
<li>It is error prone, in particular for the beginners</li>
<li>It introduce the concept of manual typing at the logging message,
which is completely undesired and useless in C++ (pollution)</li>
<li>It obliges you to learn a formatting syntax, which is cryptic
for some people</li>
<li>It obliges you to remember and pay real attention to this formatting
syntax when you try to concentrate on the logging message (pollution)</li>
<li>It is very difficult to extend (add a new letter for a particular type)</li>
<li>The default printf supported types are not adapted to modern C++ types
(std::string, ...)</li>
</li>
</ul>

<p>From my point of view, there are so many pitfalls with this syntax that
I really don't understand why some C++ logging library designers 
still decide to use it. If you are a well experienced C developper, all the
above might sound ridiculous for you. But don't forget that there is not
only C specialists on earth, there are also "dumb programmers".
</p>

<h4>The C++ way</h4>

<p>People who developped C++ also thought the printf syntax was an issue,
and they introduced the C++ stream syntax and the cout object.
The C++ way to print a message if to use cout, not printf.
The C++ way to format an output is through C++ streams operators, not varargs.
That is C++, that's what make some people love C++, and that's what most
of the C++ developper expect to find when they have to deal with message
output. It is much safer, much simpler to use, much more extensible, and
is is how "real" C++ code is supposed to look like.
</p>

<pre>void Test( const std::string & Msg )
{
    log &lt;&lt; "Message from file " &lt;&lt; __FILE__
        &lt;&lt; ", line " &lt;&lt; __LINE__ 
        &lt;&lt; ": ", Msg;
}
</pre>
<p>The use of <em>operator&lt;&lt;</em> for serializing an object in an ostream
is a kind of convention that people are free to adopt, or not. Let's take the
example of a user defined object that need to be serialized:  
</p>

<pre>class A
{
};
</pre>

<p>Some development teams will prefer to code a <em>ToString()</em> function:  
</p>

<pre>std::string ToString( const A & );

void Test()
{
    A a;
    std::cout &lt;&lt; ToString( a );
}
</pre>

<p>While others will find the <em>operator&lt;&lt;</em> convenient:  
</p>

<pre>std::ostream & operator&lt;&lt;( std::ostream &, const A & );

void Test()
{
    A a;
    std::cout &lt;&lt; a;
}
</pre>

<p>If the first group of people may not really care about the way to
format their own objects, the other ones will expect from a C++ logging
library to give them the ability to output all the object for those they
wrote a correct <em>operator&lt;&lt;</em> whithout having to modify a single
line of code. For me, it is another major key point both in favor of the use
of C++ streams and against the use of the printf syntax, because
a logging library should not assert she will be used in a "project
developped from scratch".
</p>

<p>There are many other possibilities to implement an object serialization,
but it is reasonable to consider that many of them expect to be serialized
on a standard C++ object, mostly an std::ostream (like cout).
Let's take a real life example: VTK. VTK is a big C++ library, of more
than 700 classes. Many of this objects inherit from the root class
vtkObjectBase, which defines a couple of virtual functions dedicated
to serialization:
</p>

<pre>  // Description:
  // Print an object to an ostream. This is the method to call
  // when you wish to see print the internal state of an object.
  void Print(ostream& os);

  // Description:
  // Methods invoked by print to print information about the object
  // including superclasses. Typically not called by the user (use
  // Print() instead) but used in the hierarchical print process to
  // combine the output of several classes.
  virtual void PrintSelf(ostream& os, vtkIndent indent);
  virtual void PrintHeader(ostream& os, vtkIndent indent);
  virtual void PrintTrailer(ostream& os, vtkIndent indent);
</pre>

<p>And vtkObjectBase also declare an operator&lt;&lt; on top of this
function so you can easily output a vtk class on cout, or on your log
library if you designed it in order it works with C++ streams.
</p>

<p>This is a concrete, real life example of the benefits to use the
C++ way when you develop in C++. If your logging library uses C++ streams,
it becomes completely compatible with hundreds classes of VTK, whithout
having to write a single line of code. "It just works".
That's "what simplicity means" here. In my opinion, a logging library which
can't work directly with VTK can not claim to be simple of use.
