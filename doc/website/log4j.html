<h3>The vision of logging of log4j</h3>

<p>One of the more advanced and popular logging library is certainly log4j,
i.e Log For Java. 
log4j has many users and is developped since many years.
As it is quite well documented, it is not surprising that it contains 
very good general information about logging. The design and the evolution
of this library should also be evaluated with attention, as it reflects many years
of research and evolution to correct weak points.
So, though it is principaly Java oriented, it is a very rich source
of information, even for a C++ developpers.
</p>

<p>log4j is developped and hosted by the Apache foundation,
which also develop an official port for C++, named log4cxx.
But log4j has also inspired other unofficial C++ ports,
like log4cpp and log4cplus, and a C port named Log4C.
In this page, I will discuss log4j 
in general, and log4cxx, log4cpp, log4cplus and Log4C
in particular.

<blockquote>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Almost every large application includes its own logging or tracing
API. In conformance with this rule, the E.U.  <a href="http://www.semper.org/">SEMPER</a> project decided to write its
own tracing API. This was in early 1996. After countless enhancements,
several incarnations and much work that API has evolved to become
log4j, a popular logging package for Java. The package is distributed
under the <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4j/LICENSE">Apache Software License</a>, a
fully-fledged open source license certified by the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/">open source</a> initiative. The
latest log4j version, including full-source code, class files and
documentation can be found at <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4j/"><b>http://logging.apache.org/log4j/</b></a>.
By the way, log4j has been ported to the C, C++, C#, Perl, Python,
Ruby, and Eiffel languages.</p>

<p>Inserting log statements into code is a low-tech method for
debugging it. It may also be the only way because debuggers are not
always available or applicable. This is usually the case for
multithreaded applications and distributed applications at large.</p>

<p>Experience indicates that logging was an important component of the
development cycle. It offeres several advantages. It provides precise
<em>context</em> about a run of the application. Once inserted into
the code, the generation of logging output requires no human
intervention.  Moreover, log output can be saved in persistent medium
to be studied at a later time. In addition to its use in the
development cycle, a sufficiently rich logging package can also be
viewed as an auditing tool.</p>

<p>As Brian W. Kernighan and Rob Pike put it in their truly excellent
book <i>"The Practice of Programming"</i>
</p><pre>  As personal choice, we tend not to use debuggers beyond getting a
  stack trace or the value of a variable or two. One reason is that it
  is easy to get lost in details of complicated data structures and
  control flow; we find stepping through a program less productive
  than thinking harder and adding output statements and self-checking
  code at critical places. Clicking over statements takes longer than
  scanning the output of judiciously-placed displays. It takes less
  time to decide where to put print statements than to single-step to
  the critical section of code, even assuming we know where that
  is. More important, debugging statements stay with the program;
  debugging sessions are transient.
</pre>

<p>Logging does have its drawbacks. It can slow down an
application. If too verbose, it can cause scrolling blindness. To
alleviate these concerns, log4j is designed to be reliable, fast and
extensible. Since logging is rarely the main focus of an application,
the log4j API strives to be simple to understand and to use.</p>

<p>This introduction spots several interesting points about logging:
</p>

<ul>
<li>There is a distinction between logging and tracing</li>
<li>Logging can be a good debugging technique, especially when
debuggers are not available</li>
<li>logging provides precise <em>context</em> about a run of the application</li>
<li>the generation of logging output requires no human intervention</li>
<li>the use of logging can be a more efficient than using a debugger
if the displays are "judiciously-placed"</li>
<li>Logging does have its drawbacks.</li>
<li>Logging can slow down an application.</li>
<li>Logging should not be too verbose.</li>
<li>Logging is rarely the main focus of an application, so a logging library
should be simple to understand and to use</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>The first and foremost advantage of any logging API over plain
<code>System.out.println</code> resides in its ability to disable
certain log statements while allowing others to print unhindered. This
capability assumes that the logging space, that is, the space of all
possible logging statements, is categorized according to some
developer-chosen criteria. This observation had previously led us to
choose <em>category</em> as the central concept of the
package. However, since log4j version 1.2, <code>Logger</code> class
has replaced the <code>Category</code> class. For those familiar with
earlier versions of log4j, the <code>Logger</code> class can be
considered as a mere alias to the <code>Category</code> class.</p>

<p>Loggers are named entities.</p>

<ul>
<li>Any logging API should be able to disable certain log statements
while allowing others to print unhindered</li>
<li>To do that, the space of all possible logging statements should be
categorized according to some developer-chosen criteria</li>
<li>Firsts versions of log4j used a concept of <em>category</em>
which was later generalized to the concept of <em>named entities</em>,
called a Logger</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Loggers <em>may</em> be assigned levels. [...]
Although we do not encourage you to do so, you may define
your own levels by sub-classing the <code>Level</code> class. A
perhaps better approach will be explained later on.</p>

<p>A logging request is said to be <em>enabled</em> if its level is
higher than or equal to the level of its logger. Otherwise, the
request is said to be <em>disabled</em>. A logger without an
assigned level will inherit one from the hierarchy. This rule is
summarized below.</p>


<p>
<a name="selectionRule"></a></p><table class="bodyTable">
  <tbody><tr class="b">
  <td>
      <dl>
	<dt><b>Basic Selection Rule</b></dt>

	<dd><p>A log request of level <i>p</i> in a logger with
	(either assigned or inherited, whichever is appropriate) level <i>q</i>, is enabled if <i> p &gt;=
	q</i>.</p></dd>

      </dl>
</td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>This rule is at the heart of log4j. It assumes that levels are
ordered. For the standard levels, we have <code>DEBUG &lt; INFO
&lt; WARN &lt; ERROR &lt; FATAL</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>The developer-chosen criteria used by log4j is based on attributing a level to a logging request</li>
<li>Levels are ordered</li>
<li>log4j also use a threshold mecanism to enable ou disable requests of a particular level</li>
<li>log4j comes with a predefined list of ordered levels that should not be modified, even if possible</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<h2>Configuration</h2>

<p>Inserting log requests into the application code requires a fair
amount of planning and effort. Observation shows that approximately 4
percent of code is dedicated to logging. Consequently, even moderately
sized applications will have thousands of logging statements embedded
within their code.  Given their number, it becomes imperative to
manage these log statements without the need to modify them manually.</p>

<p>The log4j environment is fully configurable programmatically.
However, it is far more flexible to configure log4j using
configuration files.  Currently, configuration files can be written in
XML or in Java properties (key=value) format.</p>

[...]

<p>Configuration of the log4j environment is typically done at
application initialization. The preferred way is by reading a
configuration file. This approach will be discussed shortly.</p>

<p>Log4j makes it easy to name loggers by <em>software
component</em>.  This can be accomplished by statically instantiating
a logger in each class, with the logger name equal to the fully
qualified name of the class. This is a useful and straightforward
method of defining loggers. As the log output bears the name of the
generating logger, this naming strategy makes it easy to identify
the origin of a log message.  However, this is only one possible,
albeit common, strategy for naming loggers. Log4j does not restrict
the possible set of loggers. The developer is free to name the
loggers as desired.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, naming loggers after the class where they are
located seems to be the best strategy known so far.</p>

them manually</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Log4j allows logging requests to print to multiple destinations.
In log4j speak, an output destination is called an appender.
Currently, appenders exist for the console, files, GUI components,
remote socket servers, JMS,  NT Event Loggers, and remote UNIX Syslog daemons.
It is also possible to log asynchronously.
</p>

<p>More than one appender can be attached to a logger.
</p>

<p>On the other hand, some people argue that log statements pollute
source code and decrease legibility.
(We believe that the contrary is true).
In the Java language where a preprocessor is not available,
log statements increase the size of the code and reduce its speed,
even when logging is turned off.
Given that a reasonably sized application may contain thousands
of log statements, speed is of particular importance.
</p>

<p>With log4j it is possible to enable logging at runtime without
modifying the application binary.
The log4j package is designed so that these statements can remain
in shipped code without incurring a heavy performance cost.
Logging behavior can be controlled by editing a configuration file,
without touching the application binary.

<ul>
<li>A logging library should allow logging requests to be printed
to multiple destinations (console, files, remote socket servers, ...)</li>
<li>We can distinguis synchronous and asynchronous logging</li>
<li>log4j allows to customize the logging destination for each group of
logging statements</li>
<li>Some people think that log statements pollute source code and decrease legibility</li>
<li>If the language has a preprocessor and logging is turned off,
log statements should have almost no impact on size or its speed</li>
<li>A reasonably sized application may contain thousands of log statements</li>
<li>Even for a reasonably sized application, speed is of particular importance</li>
<li>A good logging library should be configurable at run-time</li>
<li>Controling the run-time behavior of the logging library should be possible
without touching the application binary</li>
