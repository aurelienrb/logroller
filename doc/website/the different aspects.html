<h3>The different aspects of logging</h3> 

<img src="images/847166_signs.jpg" width="114" heigh="150" />

<p>The term "logging" is quite vague, and implies in fact
many aspects. We are going to isolates these aspects.
</p>

<pre>
logging 
  -> generating the log requests (getting the data to log)
  -> handling the log requests (filtering/formatting/outputting/saving/sendind the data)
</pre>

<pre>
generating the log requests
  -> requests generated by hand by the programmer
       -> develop a user level API to generate requests (source code consideration)
  -> automaticaly generated requests
       -> addind extra infos: source file location, date&time, thread id, ...
       -> detected application crash (unhandled exception type, stack trace, ...)
       -> monitor execution flow (thrown exceptions, trace scoping, function call, log malloc/free requests, ...)
       -> generate statistics
</pre>

<pre>
handling the log requests
  -> formatting
  -> filtering
       -> filtering policy is statically set (at compile time)
            -> filtering needs to recompile all the code
            -> filtering needs to recompile few files
            -> filtering is not configured in the source code (embedded config file...)
       -> filtering policy is dynamically configured at runtime
            -> filtering is done according to compile time settings (embedded config file)
            -> filtering policy is dynamically configured at runtime (read a config file...)
            -> filtering policy is dynamically reconfigurable 
       -> filtering at post execution time
            -> filtering is done by an external tool which process the log output
  -> outputting
       -> real time outputting
       -> delayed outputting
       -> conditional outputting
</pre>
