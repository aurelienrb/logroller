<h3>Log compression</h3>

<p>Embedding a basic log processor inside the same binary file has however
some advantages, if we can assume the initialized data section is always
loaded at the same memory address by the OS.
</p>

<p>In effect, it is possible to directly dump the binary form of the log,
as it resides in the buffer. The dumped binary data may mostly consist in
a collection of pointers to literal strings, and is therefore unexploitable,
excepted by an other instance of the same binary file.
</p>

<p>In case of a crash of your application for example, a last chance routine
can be executed an dump on disk the content of the log buffer. Then, it can
start again itself in a special mode, where it will read this data, format
them in a plain text file for example, and send the file through the internet
for example.
</p>

<p>It can even skip the use of an intermediate file, and directly read into
the memory buffer of the over instance, after the later has granted it the
right to do so.
</p>

<p>Even more, it can directly send the plain binary data, and you can use the
same version of your application to decode and format it the way you want.
By doing so, the file you will transmit over the net will be much smaller than
a plain text file.
