<h3>Simple Log</h3>

<p>Lost in the middle of the galaxy of the <i>super powerful logging libraries</i>,
a member of the Rebel Alliance tries to resist to the "Attack of the log4j Clones"...
</p>

<h4>Simple Log, a logging anti-framework.</h4>
<p>
<a href="https://simple-log.dev.java.net/">Web site</a>
<blockquote>
<p>It is written in protest against the many "logging frameworks"
that are available and recommended by many developers.
</p>

<p>Simple Log is a small library that does logging very simply and requires
you to do almost nothing (other than actually logging) to get log output happening.
</p>

<p>It is much simpler to use than a logging framework, especially in terms of configuration.
</p>

<p>It doesn't attempt to solve every logging problem in one package, but contains enough features to be a viable alternative for most applications that need logging.
</p>

<p>Simple Log is a true "Tiny Tool".
</p>

<p>With only 3 classes in a 21.8K JAR, this tool will handle the logging needs of most small- to large-sized projects, but with an almost non-existent learning curve.
</p>
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>Yes, Simple Log is a Java logging library. But it is the only library I found
which seemed to be developed in the spirit of LogRoller, i.e for "non space-shuttle
programmers". Like me, its author Graham Lea, who is also
the <i>Chief Executive Hacker</i>,
wants things to be "Simple, Stupid!". And like me, he tries to explain the
philisophy of his library:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
   Simple Log doesn't try to do everything.
   It does one thing, and it does it well, and it makes it really
   easy for you to do it. Because it only does one thing, it's really small,
   and because it only does one thing, it comes with a complete,
   documented configuration file that you only need to tweak.
   You don't have to understand the internals of the logger before
   you can configure it. In fact, you should never need to
   understand them at all.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
   <b>You shouldn't have to think.</b><br />

   Simple Log makes it so.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was really happy to discover this library, and more especially
its website which contains a lot of backdrift ideas and try
to think about what we really need. The author also spoted some
points I had not taken in consideration. The author even
discuss log rolling, which is the origin of this website.
For all these reasons, and because he seems to
know very well log4j and its bad sides, it is a good source of information
about this library of major influence in the logging sphere.
