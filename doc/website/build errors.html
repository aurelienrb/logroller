<h3>Errors when trying to use existing libraries</h3>

<img src="images/832992_weird_cube.jpg" width="150" heigh="100" />

<p>During my "evaluation of exisitng libraries", I tried to install and
use several of them, following the given instructions. The result is
terrible:
</p>

<p>As discussed in the "what is simplicity?", a library that can not be
sucessfully installed and used in 5 minutes can not claim to be simple.
As logroller wants to be a library simple of use, I tried to summurize
here the errors I got, in order not to do the same. 
</p>

<h4>Autria</h4>
<p>
When I decided to try Autria, I looked on its website for information about
how to build it:
</p>

<p><i>Austria uses the <a href="http://www.makexs.com/">MakeXS</a> build system.
It should be a simple matter of typing "make" at the top level directory,
or "make devenv" for visual studio.</i>
</p>

<p>It <i>should</i>, but it isn't. The link to MakeXS is broken (the web site
is down), there is no information about this fancy build system, I have
never heard of it, neither google
(It seems the author of Austria is also the author of MakeXS).</p>

<p>In the documentation given with the library, there is a file name
<i>makexs.rtf</i>, which seems to explain in details how MakeXS works.
I did not read it, I don't want to read the doc of a new (and unvailable)
build tool in order to evaluate a library I may not use. So I gave up,
and Austria was eliminated without having been tested.
</p>
<b>Do not use an exotic build system</b>

<h4>log4cplus</h4>
<p>
After having uncompressed the log4cplus archive, I opened the VC++ 6 project
<i>log4cplus.dsw</i> in the directory <i>msvc6</i> with Visual C++ 2005 Express.
The project was successfuly converted, nice.
</p>

<p>So I tried to build yhe solution, but I quickly get many times the
same error on this piece of code:
</p>

<pre>
    operator=(const typename _Container::value_type& __value) {
        *container += __value;
        return *this;
    }
</pre>

<pre>
error C3630: erreur lors du traitement du jeton '__value'
error C4980: '__value' : l'utilisation de ce mot clé requiert l'option de ligne de commande /clr:oldSyntax
fatal error C1190: le code cible managé requiert une option '/clr'
</pre>

<p>This is a very stupid error, caused by the Managed C++ compiler extension
introduced in Visual C++ .Net (2002). This <i>old syntax</i> (replaced by
C++/CLI in Visual C++ 2005) contains the keyword <b>__value</b>.
Because it is an extension of the standard C++ language, Microsoft prefixed
it by a double underscore, as it is specified in the C++ standard.
</p>
<blockquote>
<b>2.10 Identifiers</b>
<p>In addition, identifiers containing a double underscore (__) or beginning
with an underscore and an uppercase letter are reserved for use by C++
implementations and standard libraries and shall not be used
otherwise; no diagnostic is required.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you know that, fixing this error is really very simple:
just rename the parameter <i>__value</i> to <i>value</i>.
If you don't, you can easily lost a lot of time going in a wrong direction
inspired by the error messages which speak about activating <i>/clr</i>
option, and so on.
</p>

<p>This is a rule C++ developer don't really like to follow, in particular
for the #ifndef...#define at the begining of a header file. However, here is
a real example of a code broken for this reason. So, follow the standard
recommendation as much as possible.
</p>
<b>follow the standard recommendation as much as possible</b>

<h4>log4cplus, #2</h4>
<p>After fixing the first silly erro, comes another one:
</p>

<pre>
log4cplus::tstring
log4cplus::helpers::toUpper(const log4cplus::tstring& s)
{
    tstring ret;
    std::transform(s.begin(), s.end(),
                   string_append_iterator&lt;tstring>(ret),
#ifdef UNICODE
#  if (defined(__MWERKS__) && defined(__MACOS__))
                   std::towupper);
#  else
                   ::towupper);
#  endif
#else
                   ::toupper);
#endif
    return ret;
}
</pre>

<pre>
error C2039: 'iterator_category' : n'est pas membre de 'log4cplus::helpers::string_append_iterator&lt;_Container>'
error C2146: erreur de syntaxe : absence de ';' avant l'identificateur 'iterator_category'

</pre>

<p>This is an error reported to be in some template code, in file
<i>xutility</i> (which is part of VC++ STL).
This is serious error, which needs a very good knowledge of the STL
and template code. Even a good C++ programmer
can be completely confused and lost.
</p>

<p>The use of std::transform with toupper and tolower is known to be
difficult and very complex. The fact is a simple for loop is simpler
to understand and will have more chance to compile on most compiler.
</p>

<p>I won't discuss this issue error here, because it is not the place, and also
because this is not the error. The error comes from the
<em>string_append_iterator</em> helper class, which is an <i>insert iterator</i>
aiming to replace <em>std::back_insert_iterator</em>.
</p>

<pre>
/**
 * This iterator can be used in place of the back_insert_iterator
 * for compilers that don't have a std::basic_string class that
 * has the push_back method.
 */
</pre>

<p>I guess the authors introduced this helper class in order to solve
some portability issues regarding the STL. The problem is they
forgot to fully implement it as required by the standard, i.e by
providing the <em>iterator_category</em> typedef.
Having inherit from <em>std::iterator</em> would have prevented this
(see 24.3.1 Iterator traits [lib.iterator.traits]
and 24.4.2.1 Template class back_insert_iterator [lib.back.insert.iterator])
,but I guess the authors had a good reason not to do so.
</p>

<p>The question is: where does this error really comes from?
If the standard <em>std::back_insert_iterator</em> have been used in place of
its given replacement <em>log4cplus::helpers::string_append_iterator</em>,
this could would have compiled with no error. Even the first one would have
occured because it was inside the <em>string_append_iterator</em> class.
</p>

<p>Why did the author do such a replacement? I don't know. But it is easy
to guess: for portability. I guess there are some old compilers which
do not provide the <em>std::back_insert_iterator</em> class, so it is
a good thing to code a replacement class, because it improves the
standard compatibility of this old compiler.
</p>

<p>However, forcing the use of this helper class even with compilers
who provide a correct standard class should be avoided, become you can
also <i>remove</i> standard compatibility of this compiler by providing
a non fully standard helper class (which is very easy to do, as writing
a fully standard STL class is the job of STL writers).
We do no try to write a STL library, we try to write a logging library.
This logging library must run on modern compilers, and should compile
on future ones. If it compiles with older ones, it is a good thing,
but be aware not to do things that can break your code in the future.
