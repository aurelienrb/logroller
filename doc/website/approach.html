<h3>A simple and stupid logging library for non space shuttle developers!</h3>

<h3>The philosophy behind LogRoller<h3>
<p>
LogRoller is not really a simple logging tool.
It is a little more about that, it is a concept.
Well, okay, it is not really a concept neither,
let's say it is a particular conception of logging.
</p>

<h3>Logging, logging... For what? For whom?</h3>

<p>The fundamental concept behind LofRoller is to make it easy
to log, from a code writing point of view.
Logging some text should be really easy, and it should be done
in a way that improve the readability of a source code, not the
oposite.
</p>

<p>What is readability? Readability is quite a subjective concept.
For a given code, some one will find it readable while an other one
will insult its author. That's why LogRoller has been developped
in such a way it is easy to use yout own macro toolset, because
they are the one which fits the best your readability critereas.
For example, people will find that a very short macro name in
lower case (<tt>log()</tt>) is much readable than a long one in
upper case (<tt>LOGROLLER_TRACE()</tt>). Others don't care and will
be very happy with the default macros provided (<tt>log_trace</tt>). 
</p>

<p>However, there is some common conception of readability, and one
of them is to use comments. Comments are also useful because most of
the time they are printed in a different color in your prefered
development editor, giving some color to your code, which helps
to make it mode readable.
</p>

<pre>
char* Pool::AllocMemory(size_t Size)
{
    if ( Size == 0 )
    {
        // can not alloc 0 byte!
        return 0;
    }
    if ( this->FreeSize() &lt; Size )
    {
        // sorry, not enougth memory!
        return 0;
    }
    // ok, there is enought memory in the pool
    // allocate Size byte(s)
    char *begining = this->LastUsedByte + 1;
    this->LastUsedByte += Size;
    return begining;
}
</pre>

<p>A very personnal opinion is that comments can be replaced with
logging. I even thing that a well suited logging API can make the
code more readable than simple comments. Because literal strings
are also colored in a special color, and also because it is often
possible to customize your favorite editor to highlight special
words in a particular color, making it possible to emphasis the
use of logging macros:
</p>

<pre>
char* Pool::AllocMemory(size_t Size)
{
    if ( Size == 0 )
    {
        log_error() &lt;&lt; "can not alloc 0 byte!";
        return 0;
    }
    if ( this->FreeSize() &lt; Size )
    {
        log_trace() &lt;&lt; "sorry, not enougth memory!";
        return 0;
    }
    // ok, there is enought memory in the pool
    log_trace() &lt;&lt; "allocate " &lt;&lt; Size &lt;&lt; " byte(s)";
    char *begining = this->LastUsedByte + 1;
    this->LastUsedByte += Size;
    return begining;
}
</pre>

<p>In the above example, we use a set of 2 macros to give more information
about the behaviour of the code. <tt>log_trace</tt> is use for the normal
execution flow, and <tt>log_error</tt> to signal an error.
In this example, we return twice a null pointer, which is from the caller
point of view a failure. But we are inside the function <tt>AllocMemory()</tt>,
and returning a null pointer because we don't have enought memory is part
of the normal execution flow. We successfully exit the function by returning
a null pointer. The caller can expect this behaviour, and he is the only one
who can decide if it is an error or not. If he thinks he should not be given
a NULL pointer because he managed the pool in such a way he should have
enought memory, he may log an error. But from the <tt>AllocMemory()</tt> point
of view, it is a normal behaviour to fail to allocate the asked memory.
</p>

<p>However, <tt>AllocMemory()</tt> considers it should never been asked to alloc
0 byte. It is considered as a logic error, and it should not happen.
In certain condition, such a demand could trigger an assertion failure,
but it not applicable here as the function has to be robust even in release.
The programmer could have decided to raise an exception
(of type <tt>std::logic_error</tt> for example), but for some reason he decided
to report the logic error as a simple memory allocation failure. So the origin of
the failure of <tt>AllocMemory()</tt> is lost and the caller has no way to know
its because he made a mistake.
</p>

<h3>What is good logging?</h3>

<p>Most of the time, when people discuss about logging,
they fight about the better way to output the information.
Some people think it should be send to the debugger, others
to the console, others to a plain text file, or to format it
in html, or in xml, etc.
</p>

<p>The idea behind LogRoller is the following: forget the output,
it is a detail, not the main point. The main problem
in logging information is getting the information to log, not saving
and formatting it. And the core part of LogRoller is precisely
designed to answer this main problem. It focuses on getting
the information to log, not on outputing it. In fact, the core part
of LogRoller does not output anything. It just saves the data in memory.
This data is then collected and analysed by an optional additional
software, which will format the output the way which
better fits your need.
So, let's talk about getting the information to log.
</p>

<p>The goal of LogRoller is to motivate the programmer to give
information to log. Several points have been taken in consideration
to make him to like giving log messages to LogRoller. In particular,
the following point:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Use the standard "C++ way" as much as possible, because we only
target the C++ audience, and many C++ programmers don't like to use
libraries writen in a typical C way</li>
<li>Do not lower the readability of the code, but try to improve it if possible</li>
<li>Make the user fell comfortable with the syntax and make
it easy to customize to avoid the "Not Implemented Here" syndrom</li>
<li>Optimize the typical default usage of logging in order
not to worry the developper about the overhead of logging</li>
<li>Make it easy to integrate and compile</li>
</ul>

<p>As a result:
</p>

<ul>
<li>LogRoller is based on standard C++ stream to collect and
format the text to log (like <tt>std::cout</tt> for example).
We also think, from a C++ developer point of view, that it help
to make the code more readable by eliminating the need of brackets
like with the <tt>printf</tt> way. It also make it possible to use
manipulators from <tt>&lt;iomanip&gt;</tt>, eliminating the need
to learn a new syntax if you already know C++, and being compatible
with your own <tt>operator&lt;&lt;</tt> you have already writen
and like to use.</li>
<li>LogRoller uses several C++ tricks to make a typical logging
operation <i>very</i> fast, and <i>very</i> low memory consuming.
Such a typical operation is for
example not impacted by the length of the given string.
To read more about this, go to the performance details page.</li>
<li>LogRoller core is written in fully standard C++, and does not
have any external dependencies. It has been developped with 32bit
and 64bit architectures in mind.</li>
</ul>
