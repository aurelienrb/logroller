<h3>The cost of logging</h3> 

<p>Often, logging is used for a debugging purpose.
</p>

<ul>
<li>impact on execution time. This is the more obvious consequence.</li>
<li>impact on executable size</li>

<li>impact on thread ordonancement: can easily generate a switching context
and alter the classical execution flow. A multithreaded library can slow
down all the threads due to logging synchronisation, and augment the time
spent in a critical section if information are logged there, thus slowing
down the whole application.
Can participate in the apparition of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisenbug#Heisenbugs">heisenbugs</a>.
</li>
<li>impact on memory usage. Can interfer with memory leak detection libraries and
participate in the apparition of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisenbug#Heisenbugs">heisenbugs</a>.
</li>
<li>impact on source code confidenciality: can give losts of information (that's the goal!),
like source file tree, function names, ... Adds a lot of literal strings</li>
<li>impact on stability: if throws exceptions, contains bugs, ...</li>
<li>impact on safety: if use unsafe functions, does improper input validation, contains bugs
like buffer overrun, ...</li>
<li>impact on portability: if use copiler/OS specific code</li>
<li>impact on maintenability: if adds dependencies</li>
</ul>
