<h3>What is logroller.org?</h3>

<p>LogRoller is an attempt to define what is software logging, from
a C++ software developper perspective. It is thus a place for research and
development about logging in this language. This reflexion is done with C++ in mind,
but people programming in other language may still found some good information here
as many of the main concepts are language independant.
</p>

<h3>logroller.org is about logging</h3>
<p>Every programmer knows what is logging,
but nobody can give a definition which will satisfy everyone.
<!-- Et pour cause, -->
This is because logging is in fact much more complex that it first appear
to be. There are many aspects, many usages, and many contexts which make it
impossible to give an universal answer, because there are several antagonist
parameters that you must take in consideration, and you have to make a choice
depending on your needs. 
</p>

<h3>logroller.org is about logging in C++</h3>
<p>I started the LogRoller project because I began to write my own logging
library for C++, and as I was quite proud of my work, I thought about sharing my work
so I could get feedbacks and comments from other developpers.
</p>

<p>Before doing so, I decided to look for more information about loggin.
I quicly discovered that many people had started very interesting discussions
and done many work on the subject. I found a lot of very interesting resources, and
I decided to collect and try to synthetize them in a single place. That's
the first goal of the LogRoller project: try to define "What is logging"
and "What a logging framework should do".
</p>

<h3>logroller.org is the home of LogRoller, a competitive C++ logging framework</h3>
<p>Then, I read the source code of dozen of logging libraries, in order
to see if my ideas was not already implemented somewhere, and if there
was not other good ideas to pick up. I really did an important work of
reasearch and testing in order to find a library having the same approach
that mine, but it did not find one. So I decided to developp an experimental
library showing my concept of "lazzy logging" in use, and which could also
serve as a base to explore more deeply the possibilities and the limitations
of this approach. "lazzy logging" is in effect an approach which is quite
different to the "classic one", thus <!-- reconsidérer -->
changing the way to think about logging
usage.
</p>

<p>The library I wrote, which is also named LogRoller, is intented to be a
coding exercice, but it is functionnal and can be easily tested, and why
not used in a real project. You can find more information about this library
on its dedicated page.
</p>

<p>The aim of LogRoller is not to develop yet another log4j for C++, or
to try to do almost the same than another existing C++ library.
What make LogRoller interesting is its unique approach of logging, very
different than most of the exisiting tools. Thus, if your are a big fan
of an existing C++ logging library, you may not be very interested in this
project. However, if you haven't found yet your perfect solution, LogRoller
might be a good starting point. Just give it a try!
