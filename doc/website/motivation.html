<h3>Motivation</h3>

<img src="images/879403_simple_note_1.jpg" width="150" heigh="126" />

<p>There are several very mature logging libraries which already exist for C++.
The most famous ones are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>log4cpp</li>
<li>log4cplus</li>
<li>log4cxx</li>
<li>pantheios</li>
<li>ACE</li>
</ul>

<p>So, why yet another logging framework?
</p>

<h3>KISS: Keep It Simple, Stupid</h3>
<h3>Log++ is proud to be stupid</h3>

<p>Like any software, Log++ is stupid, it simply does what someone tried to tell him to do.
But unlike some other software, it accepts this fact and is proud to be stupid.
There is no smart feature in Log++.
Most of the time, when a feature is said to be smart, it is even more stupid
than the stupid ones. Because it tries to make decisions for you, and unless
you are dump, it is not easy to develop something which does exactly what you
want. So, I think, the best thing to do is to develop simple things that take
as few decisions as possible and give the user the ability to do things the
way he wants. We are C++ developpers, we like C++ because it does not make
choices for us, but give us the ability to choose between many different
possibilities. We don't have to the standard string type if we don't want.
We can use hundreds of other types, because C++ creators decided not to oblige
us to do so. Log++ is for C++ developpers, so it tries not to make choice for them.
</p>

<h3>Make logging simple and useful, not boring and complex</h3>

<p>Everybody wants to make software as easy to use they are useful.
However, the problem we have, us, software developer, is we design
solution that seems nice from our point of view, but wich doesn't fit
the desire of the users. Making things simple is much more difficult
than adding complexity. Let's have a look at an example:
</p>

<pre>
if(pantheios::isSeverityLogged(pantheios::error))
{
    pantheios::log_ERROR("Point: {", point.x, ", ", point.y, "; area=", point.x * point.y, "}");
}
</pre>

<p>The above code is a typical example of adding useless complexity.
We just want to log some information, we should not have to care when we should
log it and when we should not. We should have to test if the logging framework
wants our message or not, we should be able to simply log it.
</p>

<p>I even think such a code is a big mistake, because we let the code decide
if the information it logs is useful or not. In my opinion, such a decision
should only be done by the final user, i.e the programmer. I think the programmer
is a big boy, and he his the best one to decide if he want to see this message
or not. This is called <b>filtering</b>. In my conception of a good logging framework,
there should be no <tt>filtering</tt> at the source code level. Everything that can
be logged should be logged. Sure, it may generate a lot of unwanted messages, but
this can be easily corrected by the final user if he use a <b>proper tool</b> to
filter the output.
</p>

<p>
Let's have a look at a typical scenario. You develop a new class. So, you put some
trace messages almost everywhere in your code. It is very useful while you are developping
and debuging this class. However, it comes a day when your class is almost bug free,
and does everything you want to right way. At the same time, you are developping an other
new class, which also do come tracing in order to help debuging. And the log output from
the first class begins to become undesirable, because you what know your code do is now correct
and always do the same thing, so all this messages which use to be very useful in the past
are now quite comparable to some spam. You no longer need it, and even more, you don't want
to see them because they add confusion to the output you are interested in, i.e the output
from the new class your are developping.
</p>

<p>This is a very typical scenario of how things work in the real life.
Logging libraries try to solve this with level of loging. So there is the level 0,
then the warning level 1, and then the warning level 2, and the again the warning level 3,
and then come the error level 1, the error level 2 and finnaly the error level 3. 
</p>

<p>The first time I discovered this, I thought "Hum, that might be a useful feature".
Today, I am wondering who is seriously using this. That means each time you write some code
you have to think about the severity of your logging message. "Ok, is this a warning message
of level 2 or level 3?".
</p>

<p>Again, in my opinion, this is over complexified. And again, it is due to bad <tt>filtering</tt>.
Trying to decide at the source code level if a message should be printed or not by giving it a level
of interest is, still in my opinion, a wrong approach. I think it is impossible to do such a thing,
be cause the level of interest of a message may vary depending on:
</p>

<ul>
<li>the user running the software (he his the developper debugging this code or not)</li>
<li>the use of that piece of code (unit testing, debug build, release build)</li>
</ul>

</p>In Log++, we just make a distinction between messages <b>types</b>, that's all.
You can freely define you oan type. In addition to its type, a message is also attached
other informations such as the source file location. All these informations, put together,
can be used in the <tt>log viewer</tt> for <tt>filtering</tt> <b>on demand by the final user</b>.
Messages a filter by <tt>types</tt> and <tt>location</tt>, rather than by <tt>levels</tt>.
</p>

<p>The filtering of the log output is not done at the source code level.
</p>

<h3>So you log a lot of information! What about the performances?</h3>

<p>The philisophy of Log++ is to log as much information as it can.
A typical C++ developper might point out the fact that it may be slow and
memory consuming. En effect, some people do care about performance of logging.
Personnaly, I don't. The first logging library I developped had really bad performances,
and I could not notice in the final application, even in debug builds.
</p>

<p>The fact is few software generate more than 1Mo of log data after 10 minutes of use.
And writing 1Mo of text in a file in C++ is really fast nowadays, it can take less than
1 second on some modern computers. So the overhead of loosing few seconds for logging
while running an applications for 600 seconds may me discutable.
</p>

<p>However, some might argue the statistics I give are discutable, and others may give
examples where logging performances are critical. If you are one of them, I have good
news for you: Log++ is very fast and light.
</p>

<h3>How fast is Log++</h3>

<p>Log++ is optimized by design. It has been developped to log in a very efficient maner
the typical following usage:
</p>

<pre>void Test()
{
    log_trace() &lt;&lt; "Hello World!";
} 
</pre>

<p>
Log++ will log the string "Hello World!" of course,
but also the source file name, the function name, the line code number,
the message type (TRACE), and some other facultative information (Thread ID, time, ...).
</p>

<p>This will be done very quickly, by writting few bytes in a special buffer dedicated to
Log++ memory management, without any dynamic allocation. How is it possible?
</p>

<p>To understand the tricks used by Log++, let's analyse the expanded macro code corresponding
to the above example:
</p>

<pre>void Test()
{
    const static zlog_entry_static_infos entry_line15 = { __FILE__, __LINE__, __FUNCTION__, LOG_TYPE_TRACE };
    zlog::instance() = zlog::new_entry(&entry_line15) &lt;&lt; "Hello World!";
} 
</pre>

<p>As you can see, all information than can be known at compile time is stored in a static object.
Because this object is a POD, static and const, it is placed by the linker in an initialised data section
of the binary file, which means that there is no performance overhead even during the initialisation of
the application (no constructor called).
</p>

<p>When you log a new message, Log++ use this trick to associate all this information by only copying 1 pointer,
which is a very fast operation.
</p>

<p>Now, what about the message itself. Before going more in the details, lets have a look at the
following valid C++ code:
</p>

<pre>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

template&lt;typename T, size_t N&gt;
inline size_t length_of(T(&amp;)[N])
{
    return N;
}

int main()
{
    std::cout &lt;&lt; length_of( "Hello World!" ) &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}
</pre>

<p>The programm will output 13, i.e the length of the string "Hello World!" plus the
trailing terminator. 
</p>

<p>Thanks to this C++ trick based on a functionality called template argument deduction,
it is possible to know the size of a string literal <b>at compile time</b>. It also give
us the possibility to if a  string is a literal one or not. For example:
</p>

<pre>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;

template&lt;typename T, size_t N&gt;
void print(T(Str&amp;)[N])
{
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "String literal: " &lt;&lt; Str &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}

void print(const char * Str)
{
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "String non literal: " &lt;&lt; Str &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}

int main()
{
    print( "literal!" );
    std::string s( "non literal!" );
    print( s.c_str() );
    const char *ptr = "literal!";
    print( ptr );
}
</pre>

<p>Will output:
</p>

<pre>
String literal: literal!
String non literal: non literal!
String non literal: literal!
</pre>

<p>This example also shows the limits of this trick. You can not detect if the string pointed
by a pointer is a literal one or not (like for the ptr variable). You must give directly the
literal string in order to make it works.
</p>

<p>Thanks to this other trick, it is possible for Log++ to know if a string is a literal one
or not. What it is useful for? Well, for the same reason a previously with the static data trick:
if the string is literal, it is permenently stored by the linker in an initialised data section,
which mean we don't have to copy it, we can simply keep a pointer to it! And because most of the time
this initialised section is read only and protected by the OS, and because it is an undefined behaviour
to modify such strings from a C++ point of view, there is no risk to loose this literal string.
</p>

<p>So, logging this string is done in 2 simple operations: storing a pointer to its contents and
storing its length (so we can later improve its reading time later).
</p>

<p>There is of course some extra overhead due to the logging buffer management, but here also,
it is very light. The buffer used by Log++ is a circular one, of fixed size, allocated once for
all the threads. Log++ is hence designed to use a limited amount of memory.
</p>

<p>When the buffer is full, it is "rotated", i.e it is reused and the previous log entries are slowly
overwriten. This operation of resusing the buffer is called a <tt>rotation</tt>.
</p>

<h3>So, when the buffer is full, there is a rotation, and we begin to loose previous logged messages!</h3>

<p>That's true for the messages stored in the circular buffer memory. However, a <tt>roration</tt> is a
special event that can be configured to transfer the buffer content to another place before begining to
overwrite it. For example, it can be a stupid file on disk. Each time a <tt>roration</tt> occurs (it should
not happen often is the buffer size if well choosen), its contents is dumped on disk. It also have the
advantage of reducing the number of file disk access.
</p>

<p>It is also possible to let another process to save the log data by giving Log++ a buffer allocated
in some shared memory. By reading in the process memory, this other process can easily retrieve the 
literal strings an the other informations strored in the initialized data section. This can be done once
when the other process discover a particular address, so it can quickly construct a copy of the initialized
data. The <tt>roration</tt> event can then inform that other process to synchronize its copy of the log data
with the current one being overwriten, so it does not miss any log entry. 
</p>

<p>This use of another process has the advantage to give to move in another process the cost of analysing
and printing the log data. Modern computers tends to have several processor cores, so this trick help
to reduce the cost of logging in your process by running another one on another processor.
</p>

<p>Even more tricky, it is possible to reuse your process as a log manager for itself. To do that, it simply
starts a new instance of itself and share some memory with it. This has the advantage that the log manager
share the exact copy of the initialised data section, so it doesn't have to read in the client memory to
retrieve the content of the literal strings!

<h3>log4cxx</h3>

<p>log4cxx is based on the attribution of levels to logging requests.
</p>


<p>The documentation of log4cxx says (http://logging.apache.org/log4cxx/manual.html):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A logging request is said to be enabled if its level is higher than or equal to the level of its logger.
Otherwise, the request is said to be disabled. A logger without an assigned level will inherit
one from the hierarchy. This rule is summarized below.</p>

<blockquote>
<b>Basic Selection Rule</b></p>

<p>A log request of level p in a logger with (either assigned or inherited, whichever is appropriate)
level q, is enabled if p >= q.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>I needed to read the "basic rule" 3 times in order to understand it. Fortunately, there is an example given:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This rule is at the heart of log4cxx.
It assumes that levels are ordered. For the standard levels,
we have TRACE &lt; DEBUG &lt; INFO &lt; WARN &lt; ERROR &lt; FATAL.
</p>

<p>Here is an example of this rule.</p>

<pre>
// get a logger instance named "com.foo"
log4cxx::LoggerPtr  logger(log4cxx::Logger::getLogger("com.foo"));

// Now set its level. Normally you do not need to set the
// level of a logger programmatically. This is usually done
// in configuration files.
logger->setLevel(log4cxx::Level::getInfo());

log4cxx::LoggerPtr barlogger(log4cxx::Logger::getLogger("com.foo.Bar");

// This request is enabled, because WARN >= INFO.
LOG4CXX_WARN(logger, "Low fuel level.");

// This request is disabled, because DEBUG &lt; INFO.
LOG4CXX_DEBUG(logger, "Starting search for nearest gas station.");

// The logger instance barlogger, named "com.foo.Bar",
// will inherit its level from the logger named
// "com.foo" Thus, the following request is enabled
// because INFO >= INFO.
LOG4CXX_INFO(barlogger. "Located nearest gas station.");

// This request is disabled, because DEBUG &lt; INFO.
LOG4CXX_DEBUG(barlogger, "Exiting gas station search");
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>This example give me a headake. You discover the type <tt>LoggerPtr</tt>
which seems to be a smart ptr, which is the sign of a complex architecture.
The there is a comcept of inheritance between loggers. So you have to become
familiar with this concept. And then you have to print a table of requests
levels, and then think about the better level of each of your message.
</p>

<p>What is the difference between a TRACE, a DEBUG and an INFO message?
Personnaly, I don't know. So it have to be documented somewhere. So you
have to write this documentation, to read it, and to follow its guidelines.
</p>

<p>The following line:
</p>

<pre>
LOG4CXX_DEBUG(logger, "Starting search for nearest gas station.");
</pre>

<p>could have been:
</p>

<pre>
LOG4CXX_TRACE(logger, "Starting search for nearest gas station.");
</pre>

<p>or:
</p>

<pre>
LOG4CXX_INFO(logger, "Starting search for nearest gas station.");
</pre>

<p>it would be the same for me. However, from the log4cxx point of view,
it is not, there are nuances. Some people may think it is a useful feature
that add precision to the type of output. I personnaly think it only adds
confusion. 
</p>

<p>In C++, there is only 2 standard stream for output : <tt>std::cout</tt>
and <tt>std::cerr</tt>. The first one is for normal execution flow, the second
is for outputing errors. That's quite simple.
</p>

<p>Back to log4cxx, if you want to output an error, you have to decide if it is
a simple ERROR or a FATAL one. What is the purpose of this distinction, I don't know.
May be the first one is an error that is not so much an error, while the second one
is a real error. To add more confusion, there is an other kind or error that it not
really an error, the WARN level.
</p>

<p>The WARN level is the undetermined level. You never know if it is a simple information
message, or an error message. In the given example, it first seems to have a sence to
give a warning that we detected a low full level, because we think of the orange light
which is triggered when we are driving in our car, and because this is a very useful
indication of the gauge.
</p>

<p>But in case of logging, in my opinion, it has no meaning. Why? Because we put this information
in a file on disk, that almost nobody will read excepted the developpers who asked for that.
By logging a warning message, we are not switching on an orange ligth on the desktop of the car,
we are saving the information at the gauge level. Does the driver look inside its gauge to know
if there is some fuel? Of course not.
</p>

<p>The correct way to report such a warning is to report it to the user. So, you will have somewhere
a class specialized in reporting this warning, and from the point of view of this class, reporting
a low fuel level is just a normal event, that will be logged as a TRACE event, or maybe as an
INFO or a DEBUG depending on each reader point of view.
</p>

<p>So, I think warning messages are useless, and even nocive, because they give the false impression
we are doing something useful by reporting a problem. But logging is not reporting.
