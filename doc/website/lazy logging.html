<h3>What is a lazy logger?</h3>

<img src="images/small437654_52122696.jpg" />

<p><i>Lazy logging</i> is the name I gave to a simple and stupid
programming trick that allows to log some text at almost no cost.
This particular technic is not impacted by the length of the strings
to log, and is thus constant time, whatever you log. It also allows
to get at no cost some additional information like the source file name,
the line number of your log request (C++ only), and the function name
if you compiler supports it, all of that in a thread safe manner.
This additional informations are really 
available for free, if you forget the fact they will cause the size
of your application to grow because the compiler will add this infos
in your binary file.  
</p>

<h3>How is this possible? What are the limitations?</h3>

<p>There are of course some limitation. In fact, for a general purpose
these limitations make this technique useless. But in the special case of logging,
they might be acceptable, and I serously think <i>lazy logging</i> can be an
interesting idea to improve the performance of logging libraries.
</p>

<p>Before trying to define what is <i>lazy logging</i>, let's have a look at
the following example:
</p>

<p>As you can see, this example use a combinaison of <b>static</b> and
<b>const</b> keywords to make the wanted data to be stored in the initialised
data section of your program. This is only possible with data which the values
are known at compile time, i.e string literals and preprocessor constants.
</p>

<p>So, <i>lazy logging</i> is the fact to store as much data as possible in
the initialized data section of a software, in order to eliminate the need to
copy it. By doing so, it is possible to hold a pointer to the data with the
assurance the data will not be modified and will always be available.
Because it is already initialised when the program starts, and because their
value never change, such data are also not concerned by multi-threading issues,
even if their are static ones. They can be freely and safely accessed by several
threads at the same time.
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p> 
The initialisation of this data is done at compile and link time, ans they
don't need to be deallocated, so there is almost no overhead. If you consider
that this data would have been put anyway because you would have request them
in order to copy them in a traditional way, we can say that the memory overhead
is almost negligeable.
It will only
increase the size of your executable size (even more, depending on the section
alignment size, this can even be not the case). But this is not really an issue
as this information might be there
</p>

<p>So, a <i>lazy logger</i> is a logging system which is designed to be used
in a <i>lazy logging</i> favorable context. By doing so, the characteristics
of a <i>lazy logger</i> are the following:
</p>

<ul>
<li>very fast and costless logging when used properly</li>
<li>low memory consumtion</li>
<li>fixed/limited number of previously logged message available</li>
<li>almost no data processing: no data formatting, no data outputing</li>
</ul>

<p>One of the more important characteristics of <i>lazy logger</i> is that
logging a message can be done in less time than the time some
traditional loggers needs to simply evaluate if the message should be
logged or dropped.
</p>

<p>An other one important characteristic is that logging a message can be done
with only few bytes of memory, so it costs almost nothing to log a message.
</p>

<p>This fact drastically change the way to approach logging, and the way you
can design a logging library, because logging is almost free. 
</p>

<p>So, behind this stupid C/C++ trick, there is also a different approach of
logging. In particular in the following points: 
</p>

<ul>
<li>the logger does not do ant filtering, because logging is almost free</li>
<li>the logger does not do any output, this is the responsability of 
another piece of software = backend</li>
<li>this other sotware, known as the backend, is also responsible of
filtering the output as the user wants.</li>
<li>the type of logged message is usally limited to a
single string literal</li>
</ul>

<h3>The backend</h3>

<p>A lazy logger store unformatted data in a buffer. It does not take
the responsability of formatting and outputing it.
</p>

<p>This is the responsabilty of the backend. 
</p>


pay for what you need: don't pay for output, for filtering
