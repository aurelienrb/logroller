<h3>Logging for dummies</h3>

<img src="images/776061_despair.jpg" width="112" heigh="150" />

<p>Let's try to figure out what are the basic needs of a C++ programmer
looking for a logging library:
</p>

<blockquote>
<a href="http://www.thescripts.com/forum/thread470005.html">Looking for a good C++ logging library</a>
<p>
I'm looking for a good logging library that is easy to use, and well
documented.
I've already looked at log4cxx, log4cplus, and Log4cpp.
</p>
<p>
Either I couldn't find the documentation, or I couldn't figure out how
to get them to work with my code.
</p>
<p>
Does any one know of a good logging library that is easy to use, easy
to add to an existing project, and that is well documented.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is just an example, and one example doesn't prove anything.
However, I think this is the perfect and typical example of the main
concern of someone looking for a logging library. He wants a <i>good</i>
library, that is:
</p>

<ul>
<li>easy to use</li>
<li>easy to add to an existing project</li>
<li>well documented</li>
</ul>

<p>The meaning of <i>good</i> is quite vague, even for the guy who use
that word. It mostly means "a library that C++ experts would find not
too bad". But he is not looking for a powerful library that C++ experts
use to "program the space shuttle", no, he "just wants thinks to work".
</p>

<p>Now, just for fun, let's try to summarize what are the strong point
of the "various existing C/C++ logging libraries" from their author
point of view:
</p>

<ul>
<li>simple/easy to use: 12</li>
<li>easy to customize/flexible/extensible: 8</li>
<li>efficient/fast: 7</li>
<li>platform-independent/cross platform/portable: 5</li>
<li>different log outputs: 4</li>
<li>thread-safe/multithreaded: 3</li>
<li>configurable: 3</li>
<li>powerful: 2</li>
<li>Automatic logfile backup/backlog writing: 2</li>
<li>free</li>
<li>arbitrarily granular control over log management and configuration</li>
<li>enhancable</li>
<li>lightweight</li>
<li>XML oriented</li>
<li>profiling</li>
<li>type-safe</li>
<li>atomic</li>
<li>readable trace logs</li>
<li>small amount of code</li>
<li>well documented</li>
<li>UNICODE support</li>
</ul>

<p>As we can see, many libraries claims to be simple to use. In fact, it seems
to be the main concern of library authors. At the same time, almost no one
seems to think that "well documenting its library" is important, as well
as make the integration easy.
</p>

<p>For many library designers, an easy to use library is a library that has
a short learning curve, i.e a well designed API that makes it fast to learn
and understand.
</p>

<p>As a result, almost all libraries claim to be easy to use. For example,
log4cplus says it "is a simple to use C++ logging API". However,
the author of the message above tried this library, and it seems he
says he was not able to make it work with his code.
</p>

<p>That is a thing that many developper forget, and don't want to remember:
if they develop the best library in the world but no other people than them
can include it in they project, nobody will use it. 
</p>

<p>Most people won't spend 2 whole nights to try to use it. How long do you
think people will accept to spend to try your library, especially when there
are "so much competitors"? 1 hour? 15 minutes? 1 minute?  
</p>

<p>If people can't just unzip and directly use it, most of them will just
try something else. Even if an INSTALL file was given, they won't read it.
And if they do, and they discover they need something more,
like downloading and installing another library,
or download and learn how to use a build system, or something else,
yet more people will give up, and they will prefer to develop their
own logging library, because developping something new is much more
exiting than fixing bugs and trying to understand someone else conception
of "simplicity". 
</p>

<p>Then, some of them will be happy of their work, and will more or less
extract their logging code from their project, give it a name and upload
it on sourceforge, whithout giving any documentation or easy way to
build it, i.e doing exactly what other authors did in order to make
them develop their own in-house solution - full circle.
