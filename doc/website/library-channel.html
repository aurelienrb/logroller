<h3>Review of the Channel library</h3>

<img src="images/28628_soundmixer_v2.jpg" width="150" heigh="112" />

<p>The logging facilities if the <tt>channel</tt> library has been
argued on the boost mailing list by Shams:
</p>

<pre>
After looking forward to a Boost Logging library for a while, I have been
playing with this idea.

This library http://channel.sourceforge.net/ which I believe the author is
working towards
including in Boost could be used to help write the logging library? Why
because it works both
acrosss local and remote machines and supports a asyncronous subscribing
machenism.

Boost.Logging could use Boost.Channel (hopefully) to allow doing of
something like below
somewhere along the lines of...

Boost.Logging Log;

// Some of these channels could be a built-in to Boost logging.

// add one channel at a time
Log.AddChannel(new SysLogOnLocal());
Log.AddChannel(new SysLogOnRemoteChannel("remote ip"));
Log.AddChannel(new SysLogLocalAndRemoteChannel(""remote ip");
Log.AddChannel(stdout);
Log.AddChannel(stderr);
Log.AddChannel(GuiWindow);

// add lots all together
Log.AddChannel(new LocalInfoChannel(), new LocalAndRemoteInfoChannel(), new
ErrorChannel(), new WarningChannel());

// writes to the info channel
Log.Write(LocalInfoChannel, "Hello World");

// writes to the info channel
Log.Write(LocalAndRemoteInfoChannel, "Hello World");

// writes to all the channels that the logger is subscribed to (nasty)...
Log.Write("Hello World");

The possibility and the power of this thing could be, well a powerful
logging library....
I suggest you look into this library during this design phase... 
</pre>

<h4>Personnal opinion</h4>
<p>I personaly completely disagree with the approach of this library. If think
the basic Hello World example speaks enought:
</p>

<pre>
// writes to all the channels that the logger is subscribed to (nasty)...
Log.Write("Hello World");
</pre>

<p>This is the very basic use of the logging library, what every beginner will
do, and it is said to be <i>nasty</i>. So I think the design of the library
may make it powerful, but does not make it simple, which is my creterea number 1.
I also find the syntax , and the introduction of the concept of
channel useless at that level, which is also the main concept of the library...
</p>

<p>I think the attention of the user of this library is deviated from his first
concern (he wants to log data) to an other subject (where to log data, i.e a channel)
which is, in my opinion, unneeded at this level. And this concept of channel
is the main concept of this library. I also find the syntax of use of this library
over bloated (your need to write more text to log the data than the data itself).
<br />
So, said it shortly, this library does not fullfit <b>my expectation</b> at all.
