<h3>Boost vision of logging</h3> 

<p>Another source of very good information is the Boost mailing list.
If you don't know what Boost is, here is how they introduce themselves:
</p>

<blockquote>
Boost provides free peer-reviewed portable C++ source libraries.
<br />
(...)
<br />
We emphasize libraries that work well with the C++ Standard Library.
Boost libraries are intended to be widely useful, and usable across a broad spectrum of applications.
<br />
(...)
<br />
We aim to establish "existing practice" and provide reference implementations
so that Boost libraries are suitable for eventual standardization.
<br />
(...)
<br />
Although Boost was begun by members of the C++ Standards Committee
Library Working Group, participation has expanded to include thousands
of programmers from the C++ community at large.
<br />
If you are interested in participating in Boost, please join our main
developers mailing list. Discussions are highly technical, and list members
are encouraged to participate in formal reviews of proposed libraries.
</blockquote>

<p>Said shortly, the Boost mailing list is a place where many C++ experts
discuss about library development in C++.
The participants of this mailing list sometime call themselves "boosters".
Ironically, a booster is also the name of the reusable rocket which
provides the main thrust to lift the Space Shuttle in the air.
So, while the members of this mailing list give very valuable advices,
we still have to be vigilant not to fall in the developement of a
"logging library for Space Shuttle programmers". 
</p>

<p>Boost already includes many
very evoluated libraries, but does not propose any log library.
The subject has however been discussed many times, and theses discussion
threads are gold mines for people interested in logging. I tried to summarize
all I read in the present document.   
</p>

<h3>Gareth Buxton point of view</h3>
<p>I have dedicated another page to Gareth Buxton vision of logging as he is
the author of the "logplusplus" library.
</p>

<h3>Jean-Daniel Michaud point of view</h3>
<p>Jean-Daniel spend some time to read and collect information from previous
discussion threads. Here is his synthesys:
</p>

<pre>
we should definitely avoid starting from scratch again. The
problem is that there is so many divergent propositions and ideas, and
aggregate them won't be an easy task.

Here is a couple of ideas I have glanced from previous threads:

John Torjo had actually a similar point of view to mine. He was looking
for simplicity. As we are talking to a wide range of users, the library
should have almost no learning curve. Looking at the basic example in
the tutorial should be enough to get the fundamental usage of it.
John had also in mind the possibility to disconnect module of
application from the logger. For example, from a certain point in the
code, the GUI logs would be discarded. He also wanted the library to be
small, and I fully agree with this. A header file and that's it.
Not anyone agree with this, Vladimir Prus for example was expecting
something more configurable. Pavel Vozenilek added: "Maybe it is
possible to design a library which has (by default) this simple
interface but allows very fine customization." That is why I'm trying to
concentrate on the first part (design a library which has (by default)
this simple interface) and then, a second part could be handled by other
people interested in fine customization.

As a first set of requirements, Caleb Epstein stated those, and Rene
Riviera answered:
&lt;CE>: Uses iostreams
&lt;RR>: I disagree. Like most things STL it should be independent of a
stream back end. And ideally independent of a formatting front end. It
should only be a tagging, filtering, and multiplexing interface.

&lt;CE>: Thread-safe (e.g. two threads can't have their output intermixed
in the output file/stream/whatever like they would with simple ostream&lt;&lt;
operators)
&lt;RR>: Yes, but only if needed. It might not be appropriate depending on
the front end or back end. For example you might be dumping the "output"
to a database which would create individual debug records. No need for
thread safety at the log level in that case.

&lt;CE>: Multiple possible output media (files, sockets, syslog, Windows
event log, etc)
RR: Multiplexing

&lt;CE>: Multiple named channels each with configurable "threshold" (e.g.
error, warning, debug, etc)
&lt;RR>: And configurable, so that you can program what each one does on
both the front end and to which back end they go to.
&lt;JD>: The log level (unsigned short) could handle that. OR maybe a mask
would be more appropriate ?

&lt;CE>: Messages which won't be logged shouldn't even go through the
formatting step. I'm pretty sure this cannot be done in a single call
w/o macros though.

Johan Nilson also engaged a lengthy discussion. Few ideas I have retain
from him:
   Structured logging functionality. (&lt;JD>: Is it formatting you are
talking about?)
   log_item for formatting (&lt;JD>: What I called log_element in the
library I have posted).

Daryl Green seems to have a put a lot of though into this and also
define a set of requirements I'm trying to summarize here, some of them
are pure citation:
- The logging library must be very efficient in handling disabled "logs".
- The logging library must be user extensible to add new output
(appender) facilities. This should be very easy and not require in-depth
knowledge/study of library/its docs to do. Appenders, which are likely
to have system dependencies, should not be tightly coupled with the core
logging facilities. (&lt;JD>: Wishful thinking ?)
- The library must scale well. This should include the ability to
(efficiently) use a very minimal form of the library in small, perhaps
single-threaded only, apps as well as achieving good performance on
multiprocessor platforms in multi threaded apps. (&lt;JD>: The first part I
was talking about, but the multi threading shall not be an option for me).

I agree also with Daryl that a very simple, extensible library can be
submitted first and extended in the future. If we wait for a complete
logging library to introduce it into boost, we'll never have it...

Maxim Yegorushkin asked for file management (cycling through log file,
file size control). I think this is interesting but shall not make it
into the core library. Maybe an helper object, in a distinct header file
could make it. Still I think this shall not be part of the first line of
proposal as it tends to divert the discussion and prevent decision on
the core logging library itself to be taken.

Some few ideas I saw:
+ Scoped log (&lt;JD>: what is a scoped log?)
+ fast compile time

Technical questions:
+ thread id: How to retrieve thread id with Boost.Threads?
+ program name: Is argv[0] a good idea to retrieve program name? I don't
why i wouldn't, but just in case.

Now, some point raised during the formal review of John's library:
- Roman Yakovenko:
He was not pleased by the way John's library handles macro. In this
library, here is the way you log something:

   BOOST_LOG(dbg) &lt;&lt; "this is a debug message, i=" &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; std::endl;

In any case, logging avtivated or not, the message will be streamed.
What I developped in the logging library posted above is to encapsulate
the streaming in the macro, as propose by many people during the discussion:

   BOOST_LOG(1, "this is a debug message, i=" &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; std::endl);

The streaming will be performed only if necessary. Note, the library I
posted does not handle it correctly (the test is perform after the
streaming ;p), but it will.

I also see the need of a compile time disabling. Here again, I'm not
sure the library shall deal with this. Just define some macro like:
BOOST_LOG_L1(trace) BOOST_LOG(1, trace)
BOOST_LOG_L2(trace) BOOST_LOG(2, trace)
#ifdef _DEBUG
   BOOST_LOG_L3(trace) BOOST_LOG(3, trace)
#elseif
   BOOST_LOG_L3(trace) ;
#endif // _DEBUG

- Andras Erdei:
"My main concern about logging is that it changes application
behavior: often there are bugs that only surface in release code
because logging is slow and it introduces synchronizing, so logging
should be as fast as possible, and locks should be avoided whenever
possible."

So another requirement would be that the library shall be as fast as
possible (pretty obvious) and the less intrusive as possible. But I'm
afraid the caveats described by Andras are inevitable.

"I do not want to declare and define and initialize logs, just
include a header, and then write "LOG &lt;&lt; ..."; i do not want
to give names to logfiles, and i don't want runtime configurable
logs and log levels and multiline log entries and calling functions
that log from inside "LOG &lt;&lt; ..." statements"

Well, I think the initialization part is essential, or you have a
library that is deciding things for you, and I don't think it's a good
thing.

" and i do not want to
pay (with runtime and additional typing) for the features i do not
use."

Seems fair. -> Library shall stay simple. The more simple it is, the
more it has chance to get into boost and then be developed to something
more evolved. To Andras remarks, John answered:
" I made the logging library flexible (or at least I hope so :)), so
users can tweak the lib to their needs.Logging can be so much more that
writing to one file."

I think this is where troubles starts. As I said, the logging library
shall be simple to the cost of not being configurable at first. After
inclusion to boost, it can get better. Yes, it looks like petty
politics, but how come there is no logging library into boost with all
the interest it has in the past then ?

<blockquote>
As you can see, the opinions
differ widely. I think you have to have a simple interface that is
efficient and easy to use. However, you also need a way to offer
extensive customizations. This is the hard part, and where the real
problem exists.
