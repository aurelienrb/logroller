<h3>The design of LogRoller</h3>

<h4>A non powerful library which is proud to be stupid!</h4>

<img src="images/573791_balancing_act_.jpg" width="150" heigh="109" />

<p>The traditional way to design a logging library is the following:
</p>

<pre>
client source code -> extract log data -> filtering -> output formatting -> log output
</pre>

<p>The traditional log output is the console, but it can be a plain text file,
an html/xml file, a socket...
</p>

<p>This adds <b>a lot</b> of complexity to logging, because
you have to worry about the filtering of you mog requests plus
the configuration of the ouput(s). All your attention is lost
to the configuration and the use of this uneeded features at ou
level wich is : getting the information to log.
This is the only thing you should care when introducing logging
functionality into your software. Everything else is pollution, YAGNI!
</p>

<p>LogRoller does not care about these questions.
Its typical usage implies the following steps:
</p>

<pre>
client source code -> extract log data -> put in buffer
</pre>

<p>In fact, LogRoller is more a protocol to store data in memory than a
complete logging framework. It does not do any formatting by itself.
The only data manipulation done is made by third party code,
which mostly consist in the standard stream library of your compiler
and your own code (<tt>operator &lt;&lt;()</tt>).
</p>

<p>LogRoller use this libraries to convert into a character strings objects
that are not. For example, an interger will be converted and formatted
using <tt>std::ostream</tt> and manipulators from <tt>iomanip</tt>.
</p>

<p>Something very important is that LogRoller does not do any filtering.
Typical logging libraries use a concept of message level to decide at runtime
or even at compile time if your request to log something should be satisfied
or not.
</p> 

<p>While it would be possible to implement such a thing in LogRoller,
it is not the case. More a more personal and detailed explanation of
why, your can read my personal writing on level based messages.
</p>

<p>To make it short, let's say that the philisophy of LogRoller is to let
the final user to decide if he wants or not to see a particular king of
message. LogRoller just has the notion of a message type, that's all.
It's up to the final user to decide if he want to see or nor messages
of a particular type. The filtering possibilities are in consequences
much flexible. LogRoller also give detailled information about the
location of each message: source file name, line number, function name
(if supported by your compiler). This give another criterea of filtering
which is in my opinion much sharp that an arbitrary message level.
In effect, most of the time you want to focus on all the possible messages
of a particular piece of code. At the time you compiled this code,
you used to think it was bug free and so you removed all the basic debug
messages. But after several hours of running, your application crashed in that
piece of code and you really want to get as much information as possible
in order to understand what happened. That's why LogRoller does not
help to filter message logging.
</p>

<p>I think that message filtering and logging should be done else where,
why not in an external process. The only concern of LogRoller is to
save log info in a very efficient maner, so the overhead of logging
becomes invisible, even if eveything that can be logged is logged.
